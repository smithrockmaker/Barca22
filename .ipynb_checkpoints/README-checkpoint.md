### Barca22

Barca22 is a project to develop a jupyterbook to document COCC's Study Abroad program for Spring of 2022 in Barcelona. There are many unknowns and the ultimate implementation depends on student numbers. Never the less this book project is intended to provide a wide range of resources for me and potential participants. In addition it is hoped that this book might function as a reminder of the experience on many levels. 

I am the Study Abroad instructor for the COCC Study Abroad program for 2021. Originally the plan was to be in Barcelona in Fall of 2021 but like many things the timeline was affective by the COVID pandemic. At this time we are expecting to be in Barcelona for Spring of 2022. The program is open to all students regardless of affiliation (would need to enroll as a COCC student to participate). The language, culture, science, and music courses are broadly equivalent to similar courses at universities across the country and typically transfer without issue.
