### Week 3: 4/4/2022 - 11/4/2022

This week we are going to Zaragoza at the end of the week. From a teaching perspective I want to try and prep the students for discussions about the solar panels and wind farms we hope to see and possibly the moon if the weather cooperates. I'm still sorting out my approach to the MUS 101 class but some thoughts from the Museo de la Musica last week are helping it come into focus.

#### 4/4/2022 Monday

Finally the weather has cleared although the high today is below 15 C which the Barcelonians clearly see as pretty cold. Everybody is very bundled up with scarves and hats and hoods. 

Physics today we prepped ideas about electricity production from the sun and how payback times work. We also discussed the basics of wind turbines and introduced the concept of NIMBY. Good discussion.

Went out and had some sandwiches to eat with Elizabeth and the boys before walking over to Expanish for class. Apparently last week we had short classes (2 hrs) due to a scheduling conflict and going forward we'll be having 2.5 hrs of class. It's a lot and everyone's brains felt pretty fried by the end. 10 folks in a small room with limited ventilation probably reduces the availability of oxygen as well. Tired folks but everyone is learning.

On the way home we hopped off the metro at Sagrada Familia so Dawn to walk around the building. She was impressed but did not find it attractive. We walked home watching for a panaderia for bread since we were running low. Got a loaf of raisin bread (turned out to be very yummy) and some beer bread. Then we passed a household supply store where Dawn hoped to find tape and glue sticks. One thing led to another and we got the tape and glue stick but also a tape measure for physics class, clothespins for laundry, a smaller notebook for spanish that will fit in my man purse, and containers for leftovers. Loaded with bags we wandered home. Bruce stayed up a little late trying to figure out how he understood the 7 elements (or 8 or 4 or 13 depending on who you look at) of music and how to clarify them for the students. No point in getting to far ahead eh?

#### 5/4/2022 Tuesday

I feel good about how the students responded to my version of the 7 elements of music. We had a good discussion with lots of questions which meant we only made it through the element of timbre. We'll pick up the thread in Zaragoza and in the weeks afterwards.

After music class Dawn had kettlebell so I went for a little walkabout as I am begining to do, First thing I saw was a dog walker with a raft of dogs, the most I've seen yet. Most amusingly one of the dogs appears to be a Eurasier which is the same breed as one of my daughter's dogs. As the dog walker wrangled the mob of dogs down the sidewalk the Eurasier deigned to follow along at a leisurely pace. He seemed only just barely willing to lollygag along behind the other dogs. This is sort how Kody is so maybe its a breed thing.

Well organized dog walker...a little underexposed due to bright background, sorry.

Maybe Eurasiers are always trailing behind....

After class Dawn had a good chat with Leo who owns the kettlebell gym about how he got into being a kettlebell gym and all. Lovely story of gently managed growth to provide an opportunity that no one else in Barcelona seemed to want to pick up. While he was talking to Dawn he quickly introduced us to Daniel - friendly American from Phoenix who has been living and working in Spain for 18 years. Mostly in Madrid and recently in Barcelona. We talked a little bit about how to get out of the city and see a little more of the countryside and how folks live outside of Barcelona. He said that he sometimes takes a train as far out as possible and then gets off at one small town and walks 10-20 km to the next train stop. This way he always has a way to get back but gets to see a very different slice of life. Seems like a great idea.

I did some looking at some the FGC lines that go out towards the Mont Senny Natural Park area and the idea seemed plausible. It's also apparent that from most of the small towns around any of the natural areas there are trails that go off into the parks. These trails are accessible from the train station and run between 10 km and 40 km long. This might be a really interesting way to explore outside of Barcelona. Could be day trips or overnight trips. More on this later...this week is the Zaragoza trip so we're already busy.

Walked home to take a short siesta. Around 5:30 we headed out to the Museo del Desseny down at Pla√ßa Glories. Modest entrance fee and we started with the design history of the last 60 years or so of consumer goods. Some very intriguing stuff that got you thinking. Very enjoyable. That collection is on the ground floor. There are 3 other collections on the upper floors that we went to visit. The is a interesting overview of graphic design in Barcelona since the 70's. The basic thesis is that after the Franco years there was an enormous desire to rejoin the rest of the world that led to an explosion of interest in design and design culture. This rapid and passionate growth and engagement with design has become a characteristic of the Catalan culture and it's view of itself. Some really fascinating examples of poster, brand, book, and event design across the 50 years including a wonderful set of materials from the 1992 Olympics. Cool display. The upper two floors are a collection of Catalan household objects across 6 centuries which is historically interesting but hard to stick with all the pots and fabrics and wooden boxes. The last couple of rooms about the 20th century were easier to engage with for me partly due to the fascination with Gaudi. The last collection on the top floor is dedicated to the form and design of fashion across roughly the last 200 years. It is presented in a intriguing way but using mannequins that have been distorted to illustrate what aspects of the silhouette were being enhanced or minimized. Interesting way to organize the history. Given our relative lack of interest in fashion it was a quick walk through but nonetheless well done.

Home to eat and try to get HW done for spanish class. 

#### 6/4/2022 Wednesday

Mornings are starting to feel a little comfortably routine. Got to the classroom a little early which turned out to be a good thing since one of the cables that connects the monitor had gone missing. Jordi saved the day but everybody on the SAE team were cheerfully helpful. Jordi even found me some baby wipes for the whiteboard which has not been happy about being erased. 

Today's discussion about the moon and it's phases was facilitated with a sun (the orange), the earth (a Granny Smith apple - green of course), and a tomatoe for the moon since i didn't have a piece of cheese that was big enough. Students did a great job of thinking about the model and where all the objects were relative to each other at different phases. Also had a number of science practices discussions along the way. Excellent group of students! Even got a sense of the eclipses and why we have such different perceptions even when lunar and solar eclipses occur with essentially the same frequency.

Finished up going to the Arc de Triomf and working out the angular size of their fists for the first time. Also did a quick conversion to radians and did a little estinating of the height of the Arc de Triomf. We'll circle around to this topic again when we are in La Muela looking at the wind turbines.

Dawn and I headed back to Dues Sicilies for calzone's and rollo's which we knew would be tasty and inexpensive. We then walked up whatever street we were on at that point which turned out to be Carrer de Girona. We just kept walking uphill knowing that as long as we didn't cross Diagonal we weren't totally lost. Just before we got to Diagonal we passed lovely luthier's shop, [Luthier Vidal Barcelona](https://luthiervidal.com/en/), which was very beautiful and they were quite welcoming. I particularly loved the open frame violins in the front display case. I wonder if they have open frame cellos? I hope Emma gets to visit this place. Amusingly they sell silk pajamas for cellos and violins which I had never heard of. Silly me I guess.

We arrived at Expanish a little early so we went down the alley just before the building that houses the school and found a lovely courtyard where we could sit on a bench in the shade or the sun that was quiet and away from the bustle of the street. Very relaxing. 

Our Spanish classes were good as always and someone worked to keep the spaces a little cooler so everyone wasn't falling asleep. Elena leads a good class and has great technique for keeping us talking about regular things that we are doing or are happening in our lives. It provides a great venue for asking questions about things we're not sure we understand about how life works in Barcelona or how Spanish is used in context. **Note to self:** Elena felt that a single rail pass to a town would not permit you to get on and off the FCG at will. For that you needed a Zone 4 or 5 pass. It seems possible that you could get an open pass that works out to Zoe 5 for just a day or two which might work for hiking/walking trips to the more rural areas outside Barcelona -- check it.

**Odd Fact:** For some reason we were talking about how we spell things in English and how it relates to Spanish. I asked, who knows why, whether were spelling bees in Spain and how to say that. Elena said that there are no spelling bees in Spain because if you can say it you can spell it. There are no hidden or silent letters in Spanish. There would be no point in having a spelling bee. What?

After Spanish we walked all the way back to el Born where we had lunch. Going downhill at an easy pace seemed very comfortable. Dawn was pining for something sweet and cream filled and none of the shops we passed had what she wanted. Eventually we got down el Born along Via Laietana and turned towards the Mercat de Santa Caterina she saw a refrigerator in the back of a pastisserie that had what she wanted. We stopped for coffee and two of these cream puff looking things that the server wasn't sure what they were called. He found them on the computer menu and claims they are massini but we're not convinced. These looked like flakey round puffs that were split in half and filled with a frozen cream. Absolutely delicious but I can't find a picture of what we had.

From there we headed down to find The Pan Club which is a quiche spot that we highly recommended to us. Turns out they are open from 12 - 6 and we arrived at 5:55. No deal this time but we do know which alley to go down behind the Mercat de Santa Caterina to find this place. Roughly the same place we got totally turned around hunting for the Museo de Picasso. Obviously a change of plans for dinner.

We wandered up near Pla√ßa de Sant Pere looking at menus that mostly seemed too expensive for what we wanted. Since we were close we stopped in at [UP Headware](https://www.upheadwear.com/) which is one of the markers for where to turn for Dawn's drawing class. Sort of amazingly the service person remembered me from the previous week and could exactly remember the hats we had looked at. I'm amused that I can't find the particular one I bought to keep the sun off my head but I think is some version of a Tribly. This one is 100% wool felt, water repellant, and crushable. I fit a large (L) or 7 3/8. Feels very nice on but it does make me even taller.

Bruce's hat.

While I was going all shopping therapy with the hat Dawn found a really lovely sun hat that was in a light burgundy color that matches almost everything she wears. Also crushable and made from some sort of cording. The hat is made in South Africa.

I feel like we're ready for a sunny weekend in Zaragoza where we will be spending quite a bit of time outside. Weather report says sunny and warm.

Then we wandered off along C de Sant Pere M√©s Alt to the Pla√ßa de Sant Pere looking for a reasonbale place to eat. We ended up at a bistro on the Pla√ßa called [En Ap√°rt√© Bistro](http://www.enaparte.es/). Dawn had a bean salad that was fabulous and I had very tasty risotto and an IPA from Barcelona. Everything was delicious. Following a hunch I searched again for the MOB ([Makers of Barcelona](https://mob-barcelona.com/)) Co-Working space. Turned out to be a coupple of hundred meters away just outside el Born. We had 40 minutes so we see if we could find it. Indeed we did and Dawn waved at someone who let us into the space. I explained that I like to visit makerspaces as I travel and was interested in the co-working space that included 3D printing and some other fabrication tools as part of the benefits of the co-working space. She noted that they makerspace folks are there earlier in the day and perhaps if I came back I could talk to them. She was very friendly and didn't seem to mind that we had interupted her work time. As we were leaving another member of the space came out to chat next to the 3D printers and reaffirmed that the fabrication tech was there from 10-3 each day. He noted that the space immediately next door was also associated in some way that I didn't quite understand. I will have to go back next week when I have time and see if I can figure it out. Typical of the very friendly and sharing folks I usually find in this sub-culture.

From there we walked back to life drawing and dropped Dawn off 15 min early so she could get a good spot to draw from. Along the way we noticed that the [Canela Fina](https://cuinacanelafina.com/) was hosting an event where everyone one was participating in the cooking and later when we passed they were having dinner. Looked like a great experience but not sure if there is a way to join a group or if it's only for a private group or contracted experience. Their array of options looks fabulous but I'll have to write them and see if I can ask clearly enough.

After dropping Dawn off I took the hats and went home for an hour -- her class is 2 hours long but it takes me about 30 min door to door so I get an hour of work done before I go back to pick her up. Makes sense to me and helps Dawn not be anxious about getting home safely.

Because we have a Sagrada Familia entrance at 9:00 tomorrow we pretty much went to bed when we got home at 22:30 (drawing class is 20:00 - 22:00 on Wednesdays).

#### 7/4/2022 Thursday

This morning we started a trifle earlier than usual so we could be at the Sagrada Familia for the first entrance time. Dawn had got us tickets with the audio guide. We were among the first 10 or so to go in today. Took a bit of fussing to sort out how to get the audio guide on our Spanish phones when the tickets were on Dawn's iPhone. Download the app, enter reservation number and email address, and then boom -- you have the audio guide. We just put our phones on speaker, turned the volume down, and held them close to our ear as we have seen locals do sometimes.

Baseline response is WOW!. The exterior of the building feels incredibly ornate and busy. I found it intruiging but Dawn had a less positive experience when we walked around it the other day. Today, when we went inside, was a completely different feel. Inside is all open volumes, clean lines, and scale. I didn't really take pictures because others have done it better and images can't really capture the stunning feel of the space. We walked through with the audio guide and then went back on our own to moving around in the space. I could write for days I think about small details or impressions. The joy in the stain glass windows and the intentional flow of the colors through the space is stunning. The forms of the columns that make the space so open and airy are overwhelming. The creativity and quality of the art pieces whether they are the bronze doors or the cubist figures are just amazing. The following images are just things that caught my attention and are not meant to convey much about the experience. We almost missed seeing the museum because it is around a corner and down below as you are tempted to leave the basilica. Go to the museum -- lots of fascinating insights into the development of this stunning project which has been going on now for 140 years (almost exactly).

This image is from the Passion Facade and just shows the enormous structure and some of the figures carved onto and into the face.

This is the schoolhouse that Gaudi built for the kids of the workers and others in the neighborhood.
![Schoolhouse at the Sagrada Familia](../imagesBarca22/SFSchool.jpg)

These are engineering strain monitors on one of the columns of the Passion Facade. Probably watching for small changes in the behavior of the column
![Strain Monitors](../imagesBarca22/SFMonitor.jpg)

This is an example of the style of the artist who designed and created most of the imagery on the Passion Facade (just where I happened to be when I took out my camera). This is a cast bronze relief.
![Style of the imagery on Passion Facade](../imagesBarca22/SFStyle.jpg)

Gaudi designed an entire carillon for the basilica using this form for the individual bells. 7 dang octaves -- a whole piano!
![Carillon Bell](../imagesBarca22/SFBell.jpg)

A replica of the inverted model for the church in Guell that preceeded the Sagrada Familia. The hanging strings form caternary curves that minimize strain on the string. When the shape is inverted it minimizes compression on the columns that replace the strings. 
![Inverted Model](../imagesBarca22/SFStyle.jpg)

We spent about 3 hours at the basilica. Walked home stopping for caf√© and pan. Did a little work and then went shopping to be sure we had food in the house when we return Sunday night. All the stores will be closed so if we don't have it we won't be able to get it!

After we put away the groceries we took the metro down to Pla√ßa Urquinoana and walked down to the Pan Club that we had visited yesterday just as it was closing. This 'quicheria' was recommended to us by Anne -- a friend in Bend - as one of her favorite places to eat in Barcelona. About 9&euro; gets you a good hunk of one of the 12 or so different quiches they have made that day and two sides of salad. Everything looked and tasted great. Really yummy. Surprisingly they don't serve wine as an option which seems unusual for Barcelona but hey, it's a differnt sort of place. To find it go to the south corner of the Mercat de Santa Caterina (in the back and follow that narrow alley (Carrer de les Semoleres) towards the sea which will drop you into the Pla√ßa de la Llana. The Pan Club will be at the right hand (towards Montjuiƒá) end of the Pla√ßa. Bon apetite!

After that delicious meal we wandered up towards Carrer de Sant Pere Mez Alt to see if the perfumery was open. It wasn't so we gently walked home as has become our custom when the weather is nice and we're not too tired. 

Got home and checked in with Tegan, talked to our dog, chatted about this and that, and then got busy trying to pack lightly but appropriately for 3 days in Zaragoza. No telling if we got it right but we'll know soon enough and we can always get what we need. Out of concern for staying caught up on my journaling I will be bringing my laptop or I will be screwed for weeks when we get back. See you in Zaragoza!

#### 8/4/2022 Friday: Zaragoza Day 1!
