### Bruce's Journal:

Perhaps this will be a way for me to track and share my experiences before, during, and after Barcelona. I'm pretty excited but there are lots of pieces of this puzzle that I'd like to capture even when they're not the most positive.

#### 10 Days out: 6/3/2022

Trying to get used to European style dates -- small thing but just practice. I'm finding a lot of tension between trying to wrap up teaching for winter term, get a variety of critical personal tasks complete, and prepare for Barcelona at the same time. Some days I feel like I'll be able to find a way to make it work and some moments are not so optimistic. Largely the discussion I'm having with myself is about how much I need to prepare to be in Barcelona for 10 weeks and how much I can allow to wait until we're there. It's clear that it can/will be a great experience even if we never go far from home base. Even knowing that I don't want to be running all over the place trying to see everything I still feel some pressure to see parts of Spain that I might never get back to for many years. On the flip side we won't meet local folks if we're always heading out of town. It's conundrum. As I write this I realize that this is the conundrum I want to solve about travel to other cultures. To learn to not force things and at the same time learn ways to open doors and meet people with similar interests. 

I think this is why opportunities like the makerspaces and drawing classes in Barcelona feel like such an important strategy compared to going to see the castellers or a football game. I remember how good it felt to sit in the American Embassy in Moscow (at the time not such a loaded location) helping a Russian volunteer work with a Russian family learn about wiring Arduino's to do a particular task. It felt like a relatively real experience and connection. Visiting the other makerspace that supported the skateboard builder was fun and fascinating but didn't leave me with a sense of connection because I didn't do anything. Pulling some weeds in someone's garden and seeing what they choose to plant feels like it would be lovely. Hmmmm..... got to keep thinking about this.

#### 4 Days out: 13/3/2022

As a teacher or a student it would be much easier to be getting ready for study abroad for Fall term. Having to keep focus on finishing up classes (creating and grading finals for me and studying and taking finals for participants) while trying to pack and keep track of lots of last minute task is daunting. I'm frustrated not to know where we're staying in Barcelona just to be able to mentally consider the neighborhood and where the metro station is and that sort of thing. As many folks have said learning to go with the flow is an important tool in having a successful trip. I don't think I'm there yet but its always a good reminder. Friends are being very helpful and encouraging. One friend brought over a food care package for the airlines given the uncertainty of food service on flights. Very much appreciated. I'm still trying to sort out a few last clothing choices like a hat for daily use that isn't my large brimmed Tilley hat which is so clearly a traveler's hat:). 

Another thing I'm trying to discuss with myself is engaging with the students/participants through the classes and shared experiences but acknowledging that each of us will create our own trip experiences. We are here as a group and yet we are also here as individuals and it is not on me to organize get togethers. I hope they happen naturally but I need to be attentive to boundaries around my own needs. Hmmmmm...

A couple of big items have been checked off the list (taxes, money management tools, unlocked phones, meds) while there are still a couple more that I need to check into before we go (social security/medicare). Sort of getting down to the wire....

#### 24 hrs out 16/03/2022

Well, we finally heard where our apartment is (Carrer del Clot 182 C). El Clot is apparently an older neighborhood that has a distinctly Catalan leaning. The apartment is a few blocks NE of the Clot metro station which serves the L1 and L2 metro lines. L1 will get me to Arc de Triomf and L2 will get me to Placa de Tetuan. Cool! 

Current plan is to book a taxi to get us to the apartment ([Welcome Pickups](https://www.welcomepickups.com/barcelona/airport-transfer-book/?tap_a=35776-9a5baf&tap_s=312303-1982ae]) or [BCN Taxi](https://www.booktaxibcn.com/services/73-book-taxi-barcelona-airport-transfers)) The Aerobus finishes at Placa Catalunya which is still a mile away. The bus will be about 16&euro; and the Welcome Pickup is only 37&euro;. Seems like a modest difference given how tired we will be and just schlepping the bags etc.

Just doing a little exploring on google and it would appear that the restaurant Lanto (Carrer de Valencia 646) is very much loved by all who go there. Perhaps it's expensive - I have no idea -  but it's just a block or so away and everyone seems to love it and the responses from the owners are lovely. Similarly, the Italian restaurant just down the block (La Biga) impresses many folks. Seems like we won't starve in the first few days:)

Getting quite excited to start this trip. The main worry is the aggravation if we can't make the connecting flight to BCN from Paris. We are likely to need to get from a 2E terminal (non Schegen) to 2F which are the Schengen flights. Air France runs most of it's flights from Terminal 2. Here are some helpful articles to scan if we can find out where we land and leave. [Navigating CDG](https://seetheworld.travelforkids.com/travel-tips-navigating-charles-de-gaulle-airport/) gives a general sense of the layout. [Air France](https://easycdg.com/passenger-information/connecting-flight-connections-paris-cdg-airport/transfer-terminal-2e/terminal-2e-to-terminal-2f/) has a apparently clear guide for getting from 2E gates (International arrivals) to 2F gates (Schengen flights). We'll hope that we don't arrive at a 'K' gate which will push us very hard to make it to our BCN flight. As soon as we know our arrival gate I need to take a look at these and get some familiarity.

#### Day 1 (19/3/2022)

**Thursday/Friday (17th/18th):** Long day of travel yesterday. Flights were smooth if a little cramped on the long hop from SEA to CDG (Paris) on Air France. Food on Air France wass pretty reasonable. Luckly the flight arrived 30 min early since we had a short connection (65 min) to our next flight. The last hop to BCN (Barcelona) was still Air France but we had to get from the 2E terminal to the 2F terminal. Says something that Air France has a webpage dedicated to getting from 2E to 2F as noted in previous post. Along the way we had to reclear security (long lines of anxious folks with less time to their flights than us). Dawn had a little water left in her hydroflask but when I went to dump it in the trash - no other option - the security folks blocked me. Only option they said was to suck it down or throw away the hydroflask. Suck it down I did -- sheesh! We had about 40 min on the clock when we hit the line at security. We had 20 min left when we got to the next line which was also long to clear entry to Schengen. Had about 8 min left to our flight when we cleared Schengen entry (they felt sorry for us and just stamped the passport and waved us through). Hoofed it to the gate and thought we were late since there was nobody in the waiting area -- they still let us board and we were the last ones. The couple behind us in the Schengen line didn't make it - I really hoped they would. Had some leg room on last flight which helped. We had set up a Welcome Pickup for to get to our apartment and José was great about finding us in the taxi line (not where we were supposed to be). 

![Our Home in Barca](../imagesBarca22/Clot182.png)

Got to our apartment which, like many AirBnB's, has an app (Akiles) for accessing both the building and the apartment. Not surprisingly the app needs to be connected to the web so we had to turn on cell data (which we had been avoiding if possible) and then everything worked fine. 3rd floor is 5 flights of steps up but there was a tiny elevator that we wondered if it would fail with all of our bags. Made it into the apartment. A couple of images below. 

A small but workable living space....

![Living 'Room'](../imagesBarca22/LivingSpace.jpg)

The 'spare' room is the artist's workspace...

![Artist at Work (already!)](../imagesBarca22/artistAtWork.jpg)

Cozy but workable. Washing machine out on the back deck with the pigeons (pigeon is what in Spanish?). Laundry line off the back deck. IF you  drop something it appears that it will be gone forever seeing the inaccessible area it falls into and evidence of past laundry fails:)

Wifi, which seems critical, didn't match information posted on door. Emailed Alba from Dawn's account (more about that later) since it was still working hours in BCN. This is around 2;00 local time. She was able to reach the housing folks and they arrived in an hour after we had barely gotten unpacked. Wifi had rebooted to default name and password due to recent thunderstorms. Helpful guy checked to see if we could connect to wifi outside front door so we wouldn't need cell data but no such luck. He immediately said he would get a physical key for the outside door in case we needed it and delivered it within a couple of hours. Very friendly and great English which we probably didn't need but made it easier. 

We went out to walk around the block to begin to learn where we were and shake off the jet lag. Identified a coffee place for Saturday morning and a few other places like the sweets shop, local pizza place, the hamburgesaria across the street, and the yoga studio. Had wine and tapas in the local Montferry 'bar' - 2 glasses of wine with huevos con hamon (2 eggs over bed of french fries and thin sliced ham) total 9&euro;. Went back to apartment and collapse around 10:00 and slept until nearly 9 the next day. 

**Saturday:** After nearly 12 hrs of sleep we got up and had hot showers and tea. Had a few snacks left from the trip to keep us going until coffee and croissants. On the other side of our block is Carrer d'Aragó which is a divided road where we are and has a wonderful pedestrian 'park' down the middle. Couples and singles are strolling or running or walking their dogs along the way. Lovely to see many older couples holding hands while walking. Had 3 café con leche with croissant for less than 7&euro; total. We orginally were thinking that cafe con tarta would coffee with some breakfast sandwich but were quickly shown the cheesecake tartas which was not our plan for breakfast. 

After cafe and desayuno (pretty similar to what we usually have for breakfast) we walked NE on C/ d'Aragó and then up the Puente de Bac de Roda which bridges the train lines rather than a river. Met our first panhandler along the but still a remarkable apparent absence of the unhoused here. Walking back along the parque we heard a lot of activity in one corner of the parque just up from us so we walked over to find one end of the parque is set aside for bocce (apparently the name is the same in Spain as in Italy?). There must have been 30 or so folks (mostly our age or older it must be said) playing bocce. Men and women on every team. Probably 8 games going simultaneously. Serious skill was evident on all parts and lots of the joyful hassling of each other you would expect for long time friends. Perhaps it's an every Saturday thing or maybe it's only once a month. We will watch and see. For Barcelona it was cold today after rain in the very early morning. People just bundled up and played anyway. In Italy and South America most of the bocce balls I'm familiar with are phenolic (plastic). In France we have played the same game but with much smaller metal balls (I think it's called pentaque). Here the balls appeared to be the same size as phenolic balls but were metal. The colors were shiny metal and a grey textured metal. I would expect these bocce balls to be a bit heavier and interestingly many players had a supermagnet on a cord that they used to 'grab' the  ball off the ground without bending over. Never seen it before.

Found our way back home and did a little housekeeping and planning for the rest of the day. After some discussion we decided to see if walking over to the school and Dawn's possible kettlebell studio was a doable thing. Hard to tell how far it would feel really though it seemed like it might be 4-6 km overall. On the city maps Carrer d'Aragó runs straight across town passing near the Sagrada Familia and Plaça Tetuan near the school. After having some lunch - pizza - at a local pub where they had a Portland Trailblazers jersey on the wall (I didn't understand the explanation for why) we started walking. It was a lovely day for a walk - cool and cloudy. As we passed the Sagrada Familia there was an alley that we could look up directly at the unfinished central tower -- should have taken a picture. I'll try to remember this week. Mentally I thought this was about half way to the school but I had not gotten my landmarks clear in my head. We walked further along C/ d'Aragó and eventually finding ourselves at Casa Batlló on Passeig de Gràcia. This is one of the Gaudi buildings you hear about and there were large crowds on the sidewalk admiring the building. We passed on by but I realized that we had come several blocks further (7 actually) than we needed to. I was using maps.me which has downloadable maps that don't require wifi or data access. Not quite as detailed as google maps but very effective. We looped around on Gran Via de les Corts Catellanes and walked back to Plaça Tetuan and then found the school building at Carrer Casp 30. From there down a block and over took us to Kettlebell Barcelona which is just off Carrer de la Marina on Carrer de Ausias March. 

Working our way back towards home walking up Carrer de la Marina we found ourselves at a stunning building which turns out to be La Monumental. This is the former bullring which has become a museum since bullfighting is no longer practiced in Catalonia (2011 apparently). A great landmark for us to use to remember where to turn to get to the school and kettlebell. Up on Carrer d'Aragó if we had turned around when we were looking up the alley at the Sagrada Familia we would have been at just the right place - who knew -- but the park confused me. We walked towards honme along the Gran Via..Corts Catellanes until we were blocked by construction near the Torres de Glòries (Torre Agbar). Turning to walk up the Carrer de los Castillejos we came upon [The Axe Club](https://theaxeclub.es/) which is an axe throwing club. Seems very welcoming and, dare I say it, something we gotta do. These might be our people! I had a student last year who was into axe throwing in Prineville. Come back to Oregon with a new skill:)

After that we finished our walk home, bought some wine and water, and here I am updating the blog before heading out for some late night tapas. 

Tomorrow is the day of El Classico -- the grudge fest between FC Barcelona and Real Madrid. This year Madrid leads the league (La Liga) and FC Barca is in 3rd place (all of which will make Josh Evans happy and David Villanueva sad) but anything can happen. The game is in Madrid so I suspect every bar in Barcelona will be filled with game watchers. This may be why the restaurant [Lanto](https://lantorestaurant.wordpress.com/)I wanted to take Dawn to for her birthday tomorrow is closed for a private party. This wonderful sounding place is literally down the block from us.

For me all this wandering around helps me build an internal view of the city. For Dawn it is a different process. Overload was the name of the game for her and this is her visual representation of her day walking around Barcelona.

![Dawn's current mental map of Barca](../imagesBarca22/DawninBarca.jpg)

#### Day 2 (Sunday 20/3/2022) Dawn's Birthday!

Because the restaurant I wanted to take Dawn to was closed today she asked if we could get up early and walk to Casa Batllo (the Gaudi designed house we saw on Passeig de Gràcia yesterday). She got tickets for the earliest entrance at 9:00. Maps.me estimates 47 min walk for 3.5 km -- dead on as it turns out. We left the apartment around 7:15 and arrived just after 8:00. Found a coffee/panderia nearby and had a light breakfast. I bit more expensive than out in our working class part of town but only a little. Interesting to be closer in the city center and see many folks come to get take out coffee and croissants ordering in English and wanting custom changes. Counter person was very patient but worked only in Spanish though I'm sure she understood much of what was being said.

It was very apparent during our walk to Passeig de Gràcia that many small businesses have closed for the remainder of the weekend on Saturday night. Lots of small cafes etc were closed and chairs stacked and locked. Some were open but interestingly often Chinese or Greek restaurants were the only ones open. A few coffee places but we were grateful to find a nice one open.

Again we walked past the Sagrada Familia and I forgot to take a picture. Maybe tomorrow. 

The audio tour (a trifle pricey at 45&euro; but I would say worth it) of Casa Batlló was wonderful and the level of creativity was hard to take in. Every aspect of the building was articulated by the artist and was a representation of his passion for the organic world in many many ways. The doors, the wall patterns, the nooks, the windows, the floors, were all an expression of his architectural vision. As a woodworker and building it was stunning to see the level of customization that was required at every point. In our modern world it is hard to picture a house built in the early days of electric lights and before modern water systems. Interior surfaces are hard line stucco that was tinted an painted in a pattern reminiscent of foam. Sometime the pattern lines were nearly invisible and sometimes they were 24 ct gold leaf(?). Every corner cabinet door and interior served the overall design. The interior tiles in the two 5 story atria graded in color from lightest at the bottom or darker blue at the top to distribute and reflect light  more easily at the bottom. Interior windows near the bottom are larger to admit more light while higher up they are smaller to the rooms at every level have similar interior illumination. Impressively Guadi was also a consumate engineer and designed airflow and utility systems to maintain comfort for the residents before times of central heat and air conditioning. Totally amazing. Makes me imagine spending for a deeper tour of the Sagrada Familia later in our visit. No surprise that this building is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Here are just a taste of some images.

A small staircase with custom woodwork everywhere...

![Staircase at Casa Batlló](../imagesBarca22/BatlloStaircase.jpg)

A stunning fireplace nook with custom ceramic chimney...

![Fireplace at Casa Batlló](../imagesBarca22/BatlloFireplace.jpg)

This ceiling texture and scuplting is in the main salon. The foamy texture is everywhere in the house in different tones. The spiral sculpting of the plaster is only in this room.

![Wall Tecture at Casa Batlló](../imagesBarca22/BatlloCeiling.jpg)

A sample of the mosaic work which is everywhere at the house....

![Mosaic at Casa Batlló](../imagesBarca22/BatlloMosaic.jpg)

This is a tribute piece that is installed throughout the exit staircase from the house. The hanging material is standard household light chain (perhaps custom manufactured in aluminum) hanging in patterns that more and more complex as you make your way down the staircase. [Kengo Kuma](https://mymodernmet.com/kengo-kuma-staircase-casa-batllo/) is the artist. The linked images are much better than mine.

![Tribute at Casa Batlló](../imagesBarca22/BatlloTribute.jpg)

We spent 90 min or so in Casa Batlló which climbs staircases to the rooftop 6 floors up and then back down. After that we headed home to take a short rest before trying to find a place for our midday meal and to do some shopping for the apartment before the city goes quiet for El Classico. As we came home we stopped at the bread/sweets shop next to our front door and got some barra rustica (like a french bagguette but a little broader and shorter). Also grabbed a dessert pastry. Total of 3.50&euro; which I could have done with the change in my pocket if I had remembered to bring it with me. Very tasty pastry, we will need to visit this shop a lot:)


We had our midday meal at Canape Lounge near us. Not sure what we were ordering but it was tasty and very filling. I still don't need to eat anything else. A bit on the pricey side so we'll probably pass in the future but provided the nourishment we needed. It was lovely to be in a restaurant and be the only whites in the place. Lots of youngish professionals and good energy.

After that hefty lunch we walked around and around the neighborhood looking for food stores. Stopped in a couple that either had very unhappy looking fruit and veg or had a 7-11 menu of chips and soda and candy. Disappointed we headed towards where I hoped the Mercat del Clot was on the map. A slightly older feeling part of town. We passed an Islamic Center along the way multiple other possible places to eat in the future. The Mercat was where I hoped it would be and for a moment it seemed like it might actually be open on a Sunday which seemed surprising. Turns out it was a Catalan Independence gathering. Lots of music and many young folks. Couldn't see that anything in particular was going on but seemed energetic and safe. There was another lovely panederia at the edge of the market and a fruit and veg store where the fruit seemed very happy. We bought some fruit and veg as you would expect.

The Mercat del Clot is on the edge of the Parc del Clot which is a large community park built around the ruins of the old RENFE (trains) workshop. Very cool. Some folks were setting up a volleyball net in spite of the recent rain. Playing volleyball on a concrete court reminded me of Venezuela. No sand or hardwood here:)

![Parc del Clot](../imagesBarca22/ParcClot.jpg)

Made our way back home and called it a day until El Classico at 9:00. Turns out we have some american sounding college students one level up and on the other side of the building. Heard them chatting on the back deck. Perhaps we will say hi if an opportunity presents itself.

Tomorrow all the remaining students will arrive and be sent off to their homestays. Not totally clear what the schedule is but we will be heading over to towards the school to check out the kettlebell studio anyway. Hopefully after I try and set up a local bank account -- likely to be amusing to watch. 

#### Day 3/4 (21-22/3/2022)

Part of the value of journaling for me is just to review what happened along with thoughts and experiences. Because they are accumulating so fast (no surprise) it feels a little overwhelming when I don't take the time every day to write. On the other hand being out there having experiences is also the point. Mental dissonance is good right?

**Monday:** - the first day of the program - Alba went out to the airport to get the incoming students off to their homestays. In the meantime Dawn and I did a little more exploring of our neighborhood. Some more bread from the little store outside our door. Found an actual supermarket down a sidestreet that we had not visited yet -- yay! Just two blocks away. Started getting food in the apartment. Not surprisingly the store is organized a bit differently than our US stores but still very much a clean modern feel. Two amusing differences. Where we tend to have small carry baskets when you're not shopping for much the carry baskets here have two handles. One short one for carrying as we usually do and one longer one for dragging the basket along the floor in it's tiny wheels. Actually saw one local get tangled up in her basket on the floor and take a header. 

![Shopping Trolley](../imagesBarca22/shoppingTrolley.png)

The other difference that stuck me/us was the selection of fish available in the supermarket (Mercadona). Except at Fisherman's Pier in Seattle I've never seen so much fish of so many different kinds on ice. Lots to learn about fish for sure. 

After shopping we got out the door to walk over to the kettlebell studio to see a class. Modest walk of 30 min or so. Watched the class and talked to the owner (mostly in English). Very different style of kettlebell work than Dawn does in Redmond with a very crossfit feel to it. Clearly a great workout which may be just what Dawn needs/wants. Later in the evening Dawn emailed the gym and set up a class for Tuesday (2:15) after we finish our Orientation and walk with SAE. 

From the kettlebell gym (around 12:30) we continued on to Placa Catalunya - the main central square - where we were eventually going to meet up with Jordi for the first day walk with SAE. The students, most of whom had arrived this morning after 20 hrs of traveling, were supposed to find their way to Cafe Zurich on the edge of the placa at 3:00. We obviously got there a little early. We took advantage of the time to wander down La Rambla and off to Carrer del Pintor Fortuny where Casa Pierra (the vendor for Pan Pastels) is located. We tried to connect with Bernies representatives through the store staff but they had never heard of them. Also got to observe an English woman being very demanding of the staff (in English). The whole La Rambla and Placa Catalunya area seems very upscale for sure. We exited and found a cafe and had wine and tapas for a snack before heading back to Cafe Zurich to meet the students and Jordi.

We wandered about the placa for a bit observing the fountains and the various stores. Apparently el Cort Inglés is a department store for everything but I can't really imagine shopping there. It was a bit blustery so we sat inside Cafe Zurich for cafe con leche and waited for our crew. Found a very chilled out Roy out front reading a book in shirtsleeves and a class hat. All the locals are bundled in puffies and scarves since they find it miserably cold mostly. We chatted with Roy for a bit and then found Jordi out front with most of the students who had arrived that morning (looking a little sleepy). Jordi passed out our metro passes (different ones for the under 24s and the 'over 24s') along with an admonition not to lose them since replacing them is practically impossible. This is a bigger issue for the under 24s since theirs are 3 month passes and the 'adult' passes are only for a month at a time. They are apparently rarely checked by metro conductors but your passport number is required to be written on the pass. There are a lot more metro lines than I thought (11 if I look closely at the map) but Jordi says most folks only use the main 5 and refer to them by their colors. L1 - rojo (red), L2 - morado (purple), L3 - verde (green), L4 - amarillo (yellow?), and L5 - azul (blue). These criss cross town through the main parts. Rojo y morado (L1, L2) pass through our local station and get us many places. What Jordi noted is that when you enter the metro the platforms are labeled by the end point of the line. To go home we want the red line headed east which ends at Fondo. The signs are label Fondo and Hospital de Bellvitge (the western end). This is how you know which platform to get on.

Azul (L5) will get us to Spanish class after a change at the Sagrada Familia station. The spanish language courses are contracted out to [Expanish](https://expanish.com/school-barcelona/) which is a global spanish language school. The one in Barcelona is at Carrer de Pau Claris 186 2nd piso. More about that tomorrow after the placement test.

Jordi (jordi.junca@barcelonasae.com) took us on a short walk down to the cathedral and took a picture of those who were there. I would imagine the goal was to get the folks who had just arrived to stretch their legs and try to stay awake until the end of the day to facilitate their internal clocks. Elizabeth did not make it due to missed connection in Amsterdam. She arrived safely later in the evening and found her apartment.

![Group Day 1](../imagesBarca22/Day1Group.jpg)

After the walk we hopped on the metro with our new metro cards and made our way home. When we arrived at home I looked for a Yoigo store to get the SIMs for our phones and found one 1 km away. Left Dawn at the apartment to rest and walked down Carrer Valencia to the Yoigo store. Got everything sorted but needed an actual passport to setup the account. Who knew you needed a passport to get a phone? Interestingly my passport card was NOT accept in place of the passport. Walked home to get passports and my metro card and went back to get the SIM's and plans implemented. Along the way I had an interesting collision with my expectations. For whatever reason I was expecting the metro trains to have some color indication that aligned with the particular route. Red for L1, green for L3 etc etc. I was on the correct platform L2 Parallel to head west on L2 but the train that came was red with no indication that it was a morado (L2) train. I let a couple pass before deciding that I couldn't get that far off track just going one stop. Turns out that it was the correct train and there are no indications on the outside of the train indicating the line. As usual, when I got out at my stop, I got totally turned around and headed off in the wrong direction 3 times before finally heading the block to the Yoigo store. Now we have 20 GB data plans and phones but, interestingly, no SMS text. We'll see if that turns out to be sufficient. 15&euro;/month seems pretty reasonable compared to the 100/month to use our phones from home. 

Headed home with our phones (I brought open phones from the US) to a tasty meal with Dawn and collapsed into bed.

**Tuesday:** Tuesday we met for orientation (Safety etc) at SAE at Carrer del Casp 130 at 9:00. After days of very light intermittent rain this morning it poured pretty hard. Made the commute to class a little different. About half of the locals had umbrellas some of which appeared to have been rarely used since they were broken. Many stood in doorways while waiting for buses or other transportation. Didn't feel like dealing with rain was a common thing for them. Still raining hard when we got to the Arc de Triomf but managed to arrive without drowning. Signed in at the front desk (we will apparently get a QR code or card so we don't have to do this every time we go to class) and headed up to class. SAE has a small suite on the 5th floor. 3-4 classrooms and an office. Jordi took us through the presentation. We got a bit of a late start as a couple of folks got off in the wrong direction. Got the safety information and a quiz on culture. Who knew that Spainiards were among the longest lived folks in the world? They are projected to pass Japan in another decade in spite of how many smoke. Also surprised to hear that only 15% of locals attend church on Sunday. Jordi did a great job at fielding questions and keeping us on track. The room had already been scheduled for another class at 11:00 (note to self -- no hanging around after class) so we exited, had some coffee and came back to join Laura who walked us over to the Cathedral again where we met Oliver - a guide. Oliver clearly loves his work and gave us a thoughtful and extensive tour of the historical center of Barcelona that was loads of fun. Dawn has his contact info so we can possibly take a private tour in the future. Here are some images....

Oliver...

![Oliver](../imagesBarca22/Oliver.jpg)

The obligatory image of tourist in front of an old wall.....

Roman era blocks (cerca 2000 years) with holes visible for crane tongs used to set the blocks.

![Roman Blocks](../imagesBarca22/RomanBlocks.jpg)

A lovely hidden Placa (Plaça de Sant Felip Neri) showing shrapnel damage on walls from time between World Wars when children hiding in church were killed by bombing (reminiscent of Ukraine (Ucrania in es) as Oliver noted). 

![Plaça de Sant Felip Neri](../imagesBarca22/PlacaNeri.jpg)

The tour finished at Placa de Sant Jaume where City Hall is located as well as house of the governor of Catalunya. Some very upset local was in front of town hall loudly expressing his displeasure with something. Oliver said he was there the day before as well. Came and went a couple of times while we were there. Relatively civilized in a way to just stand in front of town hall and shout your displeasure. I feel like there might have been weapons involved in the US. The sandwich shop that Tegan suggested we try sometime is in the corner of this square. Oliver advised against paella anywhere near La Rambla and encouraged us to head for the port area and plan for 4-5 people for a meal. Also expect to pay. 

We found our way back to La Rambla with Elizabeth. The rest mostly headed off to lunch somewhere while we headed up to the metro to catch the train over the Marina for Dawn's kettlebell class. Got turned around again but eventually figured it out and arrived in plenty of time. Dawn got some serious training in for an hour while I watched:b. 

After class we stopped at Restaurant Rosmarin across the street from the kettlebell place for main meal. Tried their Menudedia -- 11.50&euro; with two courses, wine, bread, and dessert. Tasty and filling. Dawn had a Ensalada de Huerta which was a green salad with tuna and eggs for primero, I had a pasta dish - tasty, Dawn had Hambugesa for main course - not at all what you would expect, and I have a Carne ??? al plancha con patata - sort of a thin grilled steak. Dessert Dawn had Helada de Limon - Lemon Italian Ice and I had a flan. Both were excellent. All in all very tasty and filling. 

Walked home with Dawn leading the way. She did a great job working out her landmarks and which way to go. Still not entirely confident but getting there. Stopped into the local ferreteria for batteries and a pocket knife. Good on the batteries but no on the pocket knife. Perhaps the folding or pocket knife is called a navaja? This was part of the problem. End of long but interesting day.

#### 23/3/2022

Spent most of the morning updating the journal for the last couple of days -- I know it's not critical but I feel like it helps me review the day and things that I may have learned. After spending the morning doing digital chores including finishing up grading for winter term we headed over to find the Expanish school near La Pedrada (Casa Mila) - another UNESCO Heritage building. La Pedrada was amaizing from the outside and we will certainly figure out a way to do a tour since we had such a fascinating time at Casa Batlló the other day. 

Expanish has a number of small classrooms and a large lounge area. We stopped in to use the bathrooms and then took a little walk around. At one point we passed a place called Robot Shop which I wondered if it was one of the makerspaces I was looking into but glancing inside as we went by it was under construction so hard to tell if it 'was' the Robot Shop or was 'about to be' the Robot Shop. 

The construction world here in Barca has so many special issues to deal with compared to construction in a place like Bend/Redmond. There is lots of remodeling going on but the only place to park or store materials is on the sidewalk or in the road and that is clearly precious real estate. Construction trash is taken out in shopping carts and large poly sacks that are lifted buy cranes. We saw a cool material escalator that lifted small materials from the curb up serveral floors on the outside of a building to get to the apartment being remodeled. Small walk behind forklifts are everywhere and I know I've seen them in the US but not so commonly.

Everyone made it to the 'prueba' at Expanish at 2:00. We gathered in a room and each student was taken separately into a room with a 'professor' and engaged in conversation. I'd love to know how it went for different students but I'm sure we all felt hopeless in our own way. Dawn basically said 'I speak some French' and was asked if it was OK to be placed into the basic class. She was totally cool with that. My professor scribbled a bunch of stuff but I didn't ask what his assessment was. I assume I'll hear next week.

**Side NOTE:** A bunch of us have been finding ourselves remarkably dehydrated since we have arrived. At one level it seems surprising since is has been relatively humid (rainy) but perhaps we're moving around a lot and not having such easy access to fluids. We had some tubes of pedialyte (rehydration minerals/salts) that we have shared with some students and used ourselves. Just a thing to think about.

As we headed down towards the Gothic district to get to the Museo Picasso we passed a couple of points of interest. We were walking along Carrer de Roger de Llurià and in the block just NW of Plaça d'Urquinoana there are what appear to be a series of fabric stores all in a row. Perhaps it's just one store spread across several entrances but it felt like they were different names so maybe not? Dawn remembered this might be of interest to E. In the previous block we felt like we walked past a number of gamer shops but they don't show on Google maps. Worth a check out.

Eventually we got down to the gothic district and felt like we were headed in the right direction to get to the museum but got a bit turned around. Dawn was using google maps on our local phone with data and after a bit it seemed like it was sending us in circles. After looking at the map and watching what it was telling us it became apparent that in the narrow streets of the Gothic district the location it pegged for us wasn't good enough for the directions to stay on track. Good old fashioned map reading wa required and we finally got straightened around. Just as we got to the museo who should we run into but Oliver from our SAE tour on Tuesday - amazing to meet someone we actually knew in Barca besides our group. Oliver noted that the Museo Picasso had recently removed the section of paintings from the Blue period without any apparent notice. He was headed in to make sure his tour plan wasn't all messed up. We went ahead and went in (very inexpensive - 7&euro; for us oldsters) and spent a fascinating hour or so wandering around. Crowded but not ridiculously so. Even I was intrigued by the many repetitions of scenes or settings that Picasso did to explore the possibilities of the design and structure of the composition. A particularly cool version of this were the many paintings in the Las Meninas collection. These are paintings Picasso did modeled on a painting (Las Meninas) by an earlier Spanish painter named Diego Velasquez (1600's). Below is the original by Velasquez and one of many versions painted by Picaso.

Cool visit.

We walked back towards the nearest metro stop but it was only served by L4 and it wasn't clear to me where that connected with the lines we needed. Not too much further to just walk up to Plaça Catalunya and ride home from there which we did. 

Big steps for Dawn as we got home as she negotiated her own purchase of our baguettes (boy do we go through bread!) at our local shop. I went down to the Mercadona to get wine and trash bags. After dinner we relaxed with some The Good Doctor on Netflix (how have we not run into this before?). 

Tomorrow is the day hike at Tibidabo with Jordi and Laura. Food and fun and maybe rain.V
