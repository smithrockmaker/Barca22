### Week 11+: 30/5/2022 - 8/6/2022

This section starts with the last two days of the program and extends through our post program trip to Valencia. I'm starting to drag as I try to finish this up. Hope I can get it wrapped before I totally forget what happened (now it's 12/6/2022!)

#### 30/5/2022 Monday

Today in Renewable Energy students made presentations about topics of interest to them. Generally thoughtful and insightful. Well done. Then we walked up to Expanish to prep for our 'final exam'. Same format as before. Dawn felt better about the oral and listening parts of the exam and headed off to catch another kettlebell class. I was the last conversational exam student for our class so I got a chance to just chat with Elena. Sort of hijacked the test format to talk about the previous weekend in the Pyrennes. I will be sad to not have this class any more. It was very helpful for me. 

After all of that I picked up Dawn and we headed home for a snack. Brian and Brenda had a busy day exploring and enjoyed a siesta. We met them around 8:00 to find a place for dinner. I was thinking about an empanada place near Origo bakery but it seemed more like a take out place when we got there. Should have done a walkby ahead of time. We had noticed the [Ferrum Restaurant](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ferrum+Restaurant/@41.4000813,2.1643223,20.69z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x12a49816718e30e5:0x44b0fb3d4f47660a!2sBarcelona,+Spain!3b1!8m2!3d41.3873974!4d2.168568!3m4!1s0x12a4a2954dcc67eb:0x1cec672514b5d450!8m2!3d41.4001059!4d2.1644057) just a few doors earlier. We went back and got a table with a cheerful and helpful waitperson. Food turned out to be lovely and only a little more expensive that we typically found for dinner. I have added it to the food list as a place we would definitely recommend if you're in that part of town (near the intersection of Diagonal with Passeig de Gracia). Brian and Brenda would have gone back the next night but couldn't remember the name or where it was.

Music presentations today were mostly thoughtful and engaging. Nice to see the creativity of perspective on the part of most of the students. Hit the marks that I needed.

After a short break Jordi led the re-entry workshop which was unfortunately poorly attended. Part of this was because a group of students needed to get their pre-trip COVID tests done today for their flights home tomorrow. 45&euro; at Hospital Delfos. Jordi did a good job of leading an active discussion of expectations for our return to the US. As I write this after returning to home I have to say it has been more jarring to come home than it was to go to Barcelona which I find surprising somehow. I'll have to unpack that sometime if I can.

After the discussion we all walked down to the Barceloneta to meet for the farewell dinner on the boardwalk. Even that is an interesting example of the cultural differences since it was a solid 35-40 min walk that we just did because that's what you do. Like just deciding to walk from Pilot Butte to the Tower Theater as a matter of course. Not something you see often in Bend. Dinner was a tasty affair but Dawn was understandably frustrated to feel even more ignored than usual by the rest of the students. Most of the students have 'tribed up' with the older adults on the outside. I wonder if this is common in these settings though I'm pretty sure I could have been better about noticing and responding to the dynamic. Dawn and I walked home afterwards ready to move on from most of the group.

Today we met Brian and Brenda at Sants to catch the train to Valencia. A bit of a longer ride since it wasn't a direct high speed train. Still, we got to see a lovely swath of countryside on the way. Passed through Tarragona as all of our train rides have done and then down the coast. In many places the mountains are impressively close to the shore making for dramatic vistas. Valencia is on a delta so the mountains are further away. Estacio de Nord is not really on the north side of Valencia for some reason but it is a very lovely classic train station.

We caught a taxi from the station to Port Saplaya where Brenda had found a AirBnb on the coast. Port Saplaya is a large marina style development a little ways out of Valencia proper. It took a bit to find the right entrance to the right building but it got sorted. The apartment was on the top floor and overlooked the beach. A strong onshore breeze was blowing which allowed us to flush the stale air out of the apartment very quickly. Very lovely.

After settling in we walked down to see about getting some supplies and found a Walmart style big box store near the bus stop and did a little shopping. Lots of different systems in this store including only one way in and shopping carts locked up with some mechanism that we didn't have the key for. Carried our food and wine back to the apartment.

Later we had dinner at a Argentine seeming place also back near the bus stop end of the the development. The breeze kept blowing the loose items off the table and it was almost a little cool for the first time in a while. Slept well though the breeze died in the middle of the nightbut it wasn't too stuffy.
