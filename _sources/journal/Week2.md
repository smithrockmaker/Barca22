### Week 2: 28/3/2022 - 3/4/2022

This will be the first week of classes. Hard to know how that will change these entries though I DON'T propose to document my course materials here in any way. We'll see what transpires. Still lots of things going on put perhaps a little less for the first part of the week when we have classes.

#### 28/3/2022 Monday

First day of regular COCC classes. Actually totally in line with our home institution which is starting spring term today. Today was the first day of GS104. Couple of small unexpected things. Thing 1, when I go in the building on the ground floor I am expected to ask for the key to the room that I will be teaching in up on the 5th floor. I have actually forgotten which room I'm in tomorrow although I think it's Aula Gràcia. Perhaps today's classroom was Aula Born? Sheesh -- have to check tomorrow. Thing 2, the physical layout of the classroom suggests some different internal models for teaching. There is a large monitor set up facing the room in lieu of a projection system. The Mac mini and monitor is positioned behind the large monitor effectively hiding me from the students. It also means I have to disappear behind the large monitor to change anything. To me it suggests a very teacher controlled environment. I wonder how much of that feeling is unfortunate stereotyping on my part. Anyways....I will be experimenting with changing the set up tomorrow.

I hope I established a good model for the classes that I will be teaching as active discussion attempting to connect the broader topics we're talking about (physics, astronomy, music) to our experiences in this new and intriguing culture. I want to see if I can get them to notice and wonder about even little things that are happening around them. As an example we talked about how you stand in a metro train and why. Which directions do you need to support at different parts of the trip? How does this connet to the patterns of movement of the train? We also started the discussion about using consistent units so that you can make comparisons between different settings effectively. I won't be pushing the unit conversion in the same way but it will still be there. There was a very different sense of their response to a question I commonly ask in this class. There is a graph that we examine that shows the US effectively using 2x as much energy as Spain every day for every person to support our lifestyle. Students who haven't been in Europe aren't sure that you can live comfortably on half the energy while students in our program, after just a week, are quite sure that life can clearly be very comfortable and pleasant while using MUCH less energy. Finally we talked about energy storage in the batteries that are driving all the motos (scooters).

We finished a little early to give folks a chance to eat before the 2 hour Spanish class from 2 - 4 over a Expanish. Everyone rolled in a few minutes before 2 and we were assigned to two groups. Ella, Sandra, Mia, Elizabeth, and I were in one class and Daniel, Roy, Max, Nellie, Kiandra, Maelynn, and Dawn. Skills in each group vary a bit but this is how they chose to structure it and I think it will work. Elena is the instructor for Ella et al and Àngel is the instructor for Daniel et al. Only 3 absences allowed, quizzes every Wednesday, Midterm and Final is the basic structure of the class. Nice atmosphere and good fun in a bit stressful to listen so hard for 2 hours. Some subset of the class were headed out to get some piercings after class. Not me for sure.

Dawn and I did a couple of switches on the metro to get her to Kettlebell for her 5:00 class which appears to have gone well. Got to meet a new metro station at El Monumental which is the old bull ring which isn't used for bullfights any more since Catalonia outlawed bullfighting in 2010. Short walk down Carrer de la Marina and made it to class. While Dawn got worked over in class I took a gentle walk aroung the Fort Pienc area. Someone was filming a project in the Parc de l'Estacio del Nord which was fun to watch as they flew around the labyrinth and other features of the park. Still lots of dogs which makes sense as a dog friendly park. Walked down towards the sea a couple blocks and connected with my walk the other day down to the Barceloneta. After Dawn's class we walked home which was a comfortable 20 min across town on a lovely warm sunny day. Still very hard to be feeling a little sweaty walking around (taking off sweaters etc etc) and seeing the locals bundled up in long puffy and hats and generally looking like they are freezing to death. The young people don't seem quite so bundled up but there clearly a difference in perception between them and me about how warm it is. 

Last stop on the way home for wine (stores were closed yesterday -- should have remembered Sunday everything shuts down) and some additions to the salad. This pepper was amazing compared to the ones we get back home. Twice the size, half the price, and very tasty.

#### E-Scooters:

We talked about electric scooters a little bit today and I didn't have some of the data I wish I did. Here are some links that I found helpful in my search this evening.

[WIRED Article:](https://www.wired.com/story/e-scooter-micromobility-infographics-cost-emissions/) I have to say WIRED articles are a little tricky to use since they have a pretty restictive public view policy. I think they let me look at just a couple of articles a month. That said the core bit of data in this article (along with lots of other very thoughtful perspective) is that a scooter gets about 80+ miles/kWh. For reference my EV gets 5 mi/kWh in warm weather. A car with 25 mpg gets less than 1 mi/kwh.

[Navee N65](https://www.ebikechoices.com/navee-n65-electric-scooter-review/) This e-scooter which was released in Dec 2021 has a 600 Wh (0.6 kWh) battery which might reasonably get you 40 miles on a single charge. At least on the flat this would be reasonable.

I feel better having this data.

#### 29/3/2022 Tuesday

Originally it was supposed to be rainy today but the weather pattern slowed and the rain moved to Wednesday. Lightning storms tomorrow (rayos and truenos , lightning and thunder). As usual I asked Laura later in the day what rule she had been taught about thunder and lightning. I appeared to ask the question appropriately in Spanish but she only knew that there was a rule but her family didn't have a particular one that they knew. Very intriguing -- I'll have to ask Jordi and Iria.

Quick general overview of my plans for the music class in the am. Note to self: The folks at the front desk in the lobby don't know the names of the classrooms on the 5th floor. I confused them and they gave me the key for classroom 5 instead of 3 (Aula Gracia) that I thought I was asking for. Luckily Alba was in the office and e got it resolved. Further note to self: The sound only works through the large monitor not some other speaker set. After some discussion with the class it sounds like my model is much like the MUS213 World Music class that Nellie took. I need to spend some time formalizing the class structure over the weekend.

After class Dawn and I had coffee with Iria and Alba just to make sure that we were all on the same page about both of our participation in the various activities of the program including the Spanish classes. Both Dawn and I felt pretty good about the classes and want to continue. Alba had some amusing stories about surprises with program faculty in the past which I won't repeat here. In our conversation Iria mentioned the [Origo Panaderia](https://www.origobakery.com/) as a place that they sometimes go out of their way to get to. It's actually pretty much just off the metro from us in Gràcia so we should go and see.

After our coffee and snack Dawn led us home past the Mercat Enchants and [Museo de Disseny](https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/museudeldisseny/en). Along the way we past the [Escuela Superior de Mùsica de Catalunya](https://www.esmuc.cat/), l'Auditori, and the [Museo de la Mùsica de Barcelona](https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/museumusica/en). Lots of musicians and artists about. Definitely want to go visit the museum and there are multiple activities at the school and the auditorium that look like fun. Put all of them on the list to check out - whew!

We went through the Plača de Glories instead of around by the Torre Agbar and found a park on the mountain side of the plaza. Pingpong tables, basketball courts, gardens, and grass. Very lovely in the middle of a major construction project.

Stopped on the way home at the panaderia near the Mercat de Clot to get bread. Got a round loaf sliced (sliced on the spot not ahead of time) and a rustica type baguette. Dawn got us all the way home without much confusion.

At home we both worked on our homework (tarea) for spanish class. I had an 80 word historia (story) to write and Dawn had worksheets to do. Then we spent a little time updating journals and google slide decks before heading back to Plaça Catalunya to meet the crew for a tour of Barri Raval and a discussion of immigration and gentrification. Along the way I asked to stop in Plaça Urquinoana to look for the Ememem mosaic art installation. We walked almost all the way around the plača before we found it on the SW corner. Image below.

As we walked the block from Plaça Urquinoana to Plaça Catalunya we passed a pen store and the display out front was so lovely we went into just look around. Made me think of Mark Eberle and his love of pens and colored inks. Perhaps I'll go back and get one for him before we go home. Some of the pens were just ridiculous in price -- over 1000&euro;!

Feather pen sets....

The meeting place was at the Hard Rock Cafe in Plaça Catalunya. Laura (SAE) noted that she had been by many times but had never gone in. Makes sense to me. This is where I found out she didn't have a rule for rayo and truenos. Dan was our guide for this experience ([Our Man in Barcelona](https://ourmaninbarcelona.com/)) and was wonderful. Dan is orginally from Sheffield England but has been here since his teens. Loves the place and the history and his focus for us was understanding the waves of immigration relative to the historical expansion of the ancient city of Barcelona. The Raval, west from Las Ramblas, has always been this remarkably crowded (currently 3x the population density of the rest of the city) and massively diverse (currently 50% not Spaniards). These days the Raval is mostly Philpinos, Bangledeshis, and Pakistanis. You want good curry go to Raval (lower half), need your cell phone fixed, go to Raval (also lower half), want some fabulous desserts same message. The upper half of Raval had a couple of important cultural buildings and renovations completed in preparation for the 1992 Olympics. CCCB ([Centre de Cutural Contemporania de Barcelona](https://www.cccb.org/en)), MACBA ([Museo d'Art Contemporani de Bacelona](https://www.macba.cat/en)) and the social sciences department of the Universidad of Barcelona. The thought was to draw a 'hip' crowd down into this part of the Raval to change it's image as a place nobody wanted to go. From there....

...not quite done here....
