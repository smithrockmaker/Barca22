### Week 2: 28/3/2022 - 3/4/2022

This will be the first week of classes. Hard to know how that will change these entries though I DON'T propose to document my course materials here in any way. We'll see what transpires. Still lots of things going on put perhaps a little less for the first part of the week when we have classes.

#### 28/3/2022 Monday

First day of regular COCC classes. Actually totally in line with our home institution which is starting spring term today. Today was the first day of GS104. Couple of small unexpected things. Thing 1, when I go in the building on the ground floor I am expected to ask for the key to the room that I will be teaching in up on the 5th floor. I have actually forgotten which room I'm in tomorrow although I think it's Aula Gràcia. Perhaps today's classroom was Aula Born? Sheesh -- have to check tomorrow. Thing 2, the physical layout of the classroom suggests some different internal models for teaching. There is a large monitor set up facing the room in lieu of a projection system. The Mac mini and monitor is positioned behind the large monitor effectively hiding me from the students. It also means I have to disappear behind the large monitor to change anything. To me it suggests a very teacher controlled environment. I wonder how much of that feeling is unfortunate stereotyping on my part. Anyways....I will be experimenting with changing the set up tomorrow.

I hope I established a good model for the classes that I will be teaching as active discussion attempting to connect the broader topics we're talking about (physics, astronomy, music) to our experiences in this new and intriguing culture. I want to see if I can get them to notice and wonder about even little things that are happening around them. As an example we talked about how you stand in a metro train and why. Which directions do you need to support at different parts of the trip? How does this connet to the patterns of movement of the train? We also started the discussion about using consistent units so that you can make comparisons between different settings effectively. I won't be pushing the unit conversion in the same way but it will still be there. There was a very different sense of their response to a question I commonly ask in this class. There is a graph that we examine that shows the US effectively using 2x as much energy as Spain every day for every person to support our lifestyle. Students who haven't been in Europe aren't sure that you can live comfortably on half the energy while students in our program, after just a week, are quite sure that life can clearly be very comfortable and pleasant while using MUCH less energy. Finally we talked about energy storage in the batteries that are driving all the motos (scooters).

We finished a little early to give folks a chance to eat before the 2 hour Spanish class from 2 - 4 over a Expanish. Everyone rolled in a few minutes before 2 and we were assigned to two groups. Ella, Sandra, Mia, Elizabeth, and I were in one class and Daniel, Roy, Max, Nellie, Kiandra, Maelynn, and Dawn. Skills in each group vary a bit but this is how they chose to structure it and I think it will work. Elena is the instructor for Ella et al and Àngel is the instructor for Daniel et al. Only 3 absences allowed, quizzes every Wednesday, Midterm and Final is the basic structure of the class. Nice atmosphere and good fun in a bit stressful to listen so hard for 2 hours. Some subset of the class were headed out to get some piercings after class. Not me for sure.

Dawn and I did a couple of switches on the metro to get her to Kettlebell for her 5:00 class which appears to have gone well. Got to meet a new metro station at El Monumental which is the old bull ring which isn't used for bullfights any more since Catalonia outlawed bullfighting in 2010. Short walk down Carrer de la Marina and made it to class. While Dawn got worked over in class I took a gentle walk aroung the Fort Pienc area. Someone was filming a project in the Parc de l'Estacio del Nord which was fun to watch as they flew around the labyrinth and other features of the park. Still lots of dogs which makes sense as a dog friendly park. Walked down towards the sea a couple blocks and connected with my walk the other day down to the Barceloneta. After Dawn's class we walked home which was a comfortable 20 min across town on a lovely warm sunny day. Still very hard to be feeling a little sweaty walking around (taking off sweaters etc etc) and seeing the locals bundled up in long puffy and hats and generally looking like they are freezing to death. The young people don't seem quite so bundled up but there clearly a difference in perception between them and me about how warm it is. 

Last stop on the way home for wine (stores were closed yesterday -- should have remembered Sunday everything shuts down) and some additions to the salad. This pepper was amazing compared to the ones we get back home. Twice the size, half the price, and very tasty.

#### E-Scooters:

We talked about electric scooters a little bit today and I didn't have some of the data I wish I did. Here are some links that I found helpful in my search this evening.

[WIRED Article:](https://www.wired.com/story/e-scooter-micromobility-infographics-cost-emissions/) I have to say WIRED articles are a little tricky to use since they have a pretty restictive public view policy. I think they let me look at just a couple of articles a month. That said the core bit of data in this article (along with lots of other very thoughtful perspective) is that a scooter gets about 80+ miles/kWh. For reference my EV gets 5 mi/kWh in warm weather. A car with 25 mpg gets less than 1 mi/kwh.

[Navee N65](https://www.ebikechoices.com/navee-n65-electric-scooter-review/) This e-scooter which was released in Dec 2021 has a 600 Wh (0.6 kWh) battery which might reasonably get you 40 miles on a single charge. At least on the flat this would be reasonable.

I feel better having this data.

#### 29/3/2022 Tuesday

Originally it was supposed to be rainy today but the weather pattern slowed and the rain moved to Wednesday. Lightning storms tomorrow (rayos and truenos , lightning and thunder). As usual I asked Laura later in the day what rule she had been taught about thunder and lightning. I appeared to ask the question appropriately in Spanish but she only knew that there was a rule but her family didn't have a particular one that they knew. Very intriguing -- I'll have to ask Jordi and Iria.

Quick general overview of my plans for the music class in the am. Note to self: The folks at the front desk in the lobby don't know the names of the classrooms on the 5th floor. I confused them and they gave me the key for classroom 5 instead of 3 (Aula Gracia) that I thought I was asking for. Luckily Alba was in the office and e got it resolved. Further note to self: The sound only works through the large monitor not some other speaker set. After some discussion with the class it sounds like my model is much like the MUS213 World Music class that Nellie took. I need to spend some time formalizing the class structure over the weekend.

After class Dawn and I had coffee with Iria and Alba just to make sure that we were all on the same page about both of our participation in the various activities of the program including the Spanish classes. Both Dawn and I felt pretty good about the classes and want to continue. Alba had some amusing stories about surprises with program faculty in the past which I won't repeat here. In our conversation Iria mentioned the [Origo Panaderia](https://www.origobakery.com/) as a place that they sometimes go out of their way to get to. It's actually pretty much just off the metro from us in Gràcia so we should go and see.

I mentioned to Iria that I thought I had found a circus school near us in el Clot and she lit up with a story about a friend who had trained there. She had forgotten it was there but was very excited. Her friend trained with the silks I think but I don't remember whether it led to work or just joy. For the record the school is [Atlantis: El Surgir del Arte](https://espaiatlantis.es/index.php/es/) and it is located maybe a km directly north of us at Carrer Marti Molins 21. 

Note to self: Somewhere along that path is the woodworking co-working space that I found while exploring makerspaces.

After our coffee and snack Dawn led us home past the Mercat Enchants and [Museo de Disseny](https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/museudeldisseny/en). Along the way we past the [Escuela Superior de Mùsica de Catalunya](https://www.esmuc.cat/), l'Auditori, and the [Museo de la Mùsica de Barcelona](https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/museumusica/en). Lots of musicians and artists about. Definitely want to go visit the museum and there are multiple activities at the school and the auditorium that look like fun. Put all of them on the list to check out - whew!

We went through the Plača de Glories instead of around by the Torre Agbar and found a park on the mountain side of the plaza. Pingpong tables, basketball courts, gardens, and grass. Very lovely in the middle of a major construction project.

Stopped on the way home at the panaderia near the Mercat de Clot to get bread. Got a round loaf sliced (sliced on the spot not ahead of time) and a rustica type baguette. Dawn got us all the way home without much confusion.

At home we both worked on our homework (tarea) for spanish class. I had an 80 word historia (story) to write and Dawn had worksheets to do. Then we spent a little time updating journals and google slide decks before heading back to Plaça Catalunya to meet the crew for a tour of Barri Raval and a discussion of immigration and gentrification. Along the way I asked to stop in Plaça Urquinoana to look for the Ememem mosaic art installation. We walked almost all the way around the plača before we found it on the SW corner. Image below.

![Mosaic Art Plaça Urquinoana](../imagesBarca22/emememArt.jpg)

As we walked the block from Plaça Urquinoana to Plaça Catalunya we passed a pen store and the display out front was so lovely we went into just look around. Made me think of Mark Eberle and his love of pens and colored inks. Perhaps I'll go back and get one for him before we go home. Some of the pens were just ridiculous in price -- over 1000&euro;!

Feather pen sets....
![Feather pen sets near Plaça Urquinoana](../imagesBarca22/pensMark.jpg)

The meeting place was at the Hard Rock Cafe in Plaça Catalunya. Laura (SAE) noted that she had been by many times but had never gone in. Makes sense to me. This is where I found out she didn't have a rule for rayo and truenos. Dan was our guide for this experience ([Our Man in Barcelona](https://ourmaninbarcelona.com/)) and was wonderful. Dan is orginally from Sheffield England but has been here since his teens. Loves the place and the history and his focus for us was understanding the waves of immigration relative to the historical expansion of the ancient city of Barcelona. The Raval, west from Las Ramblas, has always been this remarkably crowded (currently 3x the population density of the rest of the city) and massively diverse (currently 50% not Spaniards). These days the Raval is mostly Philpinos, Bangledeshis, and Pakistanis. You want good curry go to Raval (lower half), need your cell phone fixed, go to Raval (also lower half), want some fabulous desserts same message. The upper half of Raval had a couple of important cultural buildings and renovations completed in preparation for the 1992 Olympics. CCCB ([Centre de Cutural Contemporania de Barcelona](https://www.cccb.org/en)), MACBA ([Museo d'Art Contemporani de Bacelona](https://www.macba.cat/en)) and the social sciences department of the Universidad of Barcelona. The thought was to draw a 'hip' crowd down into this part of the Raval to change it's image as a place nobody wanted to go. From there we walked down to the lower part of Raval which is now a largely Pakistani and Bangledeshi community. We walked a lovely rambla (boulevard) that had been created 20? years ago by taking down 3 streets worth of dense apartment blocks. Dan noted that this, like the cultural buildings in the upper Raval signals human value to the residents of an area where nice urban features are created. A major artist ([Fernando Botero](https://www.theartstory.org/artist/botero-fernando/)) was commissioned to create a work of art for the rambla now known as el Gato de Botero -- very cute (mono)!

Gato de Botero in the Raval
![Gato de Botero in el Raval](../imagesBarca22/gatodeBotero.jpg)

In addition, the heaquarters of first labor union in Spain were in this part of the Raval. When the apartment blocks were taken down they rebuild their new headquarters along la rambla. Right next door is a 4 star hotel [Barceló Raval](https://www.barcelo.com/en-us/barcelo-raval/) which has a exterior skin just away from the building walls like so may buidings we are seeing here in Barcelona. I must look into the history of that design feature.

From there we wandered back over to La Rambla where Dan did a great job of summing up for the benefit of Mia and Kiandra who had been trying to find the group for a while. Location services don't work very well in narrow alleys of the old city. We said our goodbyes and went back across the Raval in search of the Mercat Sant Antoní. The Carrer de l'Hospital goes right past the old hospital (where Gaudi died after being hit by a cable car? and having no ID to know him by) and past the 'top' end of the Rambla del Raval and drops you out on the edge of Raval facing the market. It seemed pretty quite inside with only about 1/3 of the stalls open but the range and quality of food available was stunning. I now know that I need to study up on olives because there are clearly way more ways to cure olives than we see in the US. One vendor only sells olives and the display case/refrigerator was 8 m long. 

Good to know that the Mercat Sant Antoní is a stop on the L2 (Linea Morado) which we can get at the Clot metro station. Straight shot if we want to visit or go shopping. Bit of a day at this point so we took the metro home.

This is now two days ago so actually have no clear memory of what we did when we got home. It was around 18:30 or so so I suspect we made dinner, chilled out, and went to bed. Wednesdays are busy days.

This is getting nuts. As the days pass I keep getting further and further behind. As Dawn and I got back to the apartment after a reasonablylong day visiting Montserrat we were talking about how easily we lose the details of what has happened during a day when we don't get a chance to revisit they day through writing for me or updating the google slide deck for Dawn. We'll see how fast I can get through this day and try to replay yesterday which is almost gone from my mind.

After doing some looking online it seemed like the most useful information about visiting the Monastery at Montserrat was on [this page](https://www.barcelona-tourist-guide.com/en/tour/barcelona-montserrat.html). A couple of things that came up along the way that were not clear from my reading of the material are noted below. We opted to get started early with the theory that if something went wrong we would have more time to sort out a solution and not get stressed. 

**R5 Labeling:** The webpage seems to suggest that finding the R5 platform is confusing. We didn't find it too bad but you did have to look carefully at the many labels up near the ceiling level that seem to happen when rail and metro stations are combined.

**Ticket Vending Machines:** When the webpage says the tickets are available at the platform I think of the actual platform next to where the train is so that is where we went first. No ticket machine there. The ticket machines are just before the ticket turnstiles before you get to the train platform. Makes sense but I interpreted it wrong. 

**Ticket Vending Machines: Cash ONLY!** Based on the webpage I was planning to purchase the Trans Ticket for each of us since it was a reasonable deal. Remember that a return ticket in Europe is what we call a round trip ticket in the US. Definitely prudent to by a 'return' ticket since it is 60% of the price of 2 one way tickets. The issue was that I could not locate the "Trans" ticket on the ticket vending machine for love or money. I think you can get it at the ticket booth BUT!!! the ticket both didn't/couldn't sell Aeri (cable car) tickets and that's what we wanted. ....and it was incredibly slow even with just 3 people in line. So..... we got our tickets at the vending machines but there was another issue. We tried every credit and debit card that we had and they were rejected. I assumed that the problem was with my card issuer so I called them but it turns out the issue is that the metro vending machines do not like/accept credit cards from outside Spain. This is consistent with the problem I had getting a quick ticket for Dawn when she lost her pass on Tibidabo. We got come case from an ATM (steep transfer fee - ick) and then things went smoothly for getting an R5 + Cable car ticket. 

**Cable Car/Cremallera:** We enjoyed the cable car and it was very quick. Important to note that whatever method you use to go up you have to use to go down. We did see a couple of folks get caught going up on the cremallera and wanting to go down on the cable car (Aeri) but getting turned away. 

We had a pleasant ride up though even at 8:16 the train was a good bit more crowded than we expected. Clearly a lot of folks live out in the suburbs along the R5 line and even though we imagine that Montserrat is a major attraction the regular users are a bigger volume. Sandra come out later and said the R5 felt like a metro train with the number of people on it. We were able to snooze or watch the countryside go by. Most of the trip is above ground which is nice. **Note to self:** While it's tempting to take the 'old folks' seats near the entrance my legs are so long that it is much more comfortable to take one of the seats 'facing the aisle' since from those seats I can always extend my leg unless the train is very crowded.

Enough about travel details!! We arrived at Monistol Montserrat on the first cable car of the day. There were only 8 of us in the car so everyone got a 'window seat' which was lovely. I didn't realize until we were out in the open air that some of the window were actually only partly glassed so the wind was howling through the tin can that was the cable car. Later in the day when Sandra came up she said it felt like sardines in a can they were packed in so tight. I chatted with the operator on our way back and he said that 2 or 3 days a year the wind blows hard enough to swing the cable car enough to risk hitting the towers and then they shut it down -- can hardly imagine.

From the cable car .... sorry about the reflections
![Voiew fropm Aeri cable car](../imagesBarca22/AeriView.jpg)

There is a short walk from the Aeri arrival station up to the base of the monastery complex. Guidance seemed a little unclear but we found a set of stairs that took us up to the main plaza outside an imposing building that turned out to be the basilica. The normal church like front was hidden inside the building which is a bit different. We walked around the plaza and looked at the stunning views. The image below was taken later in the day but you can get a sense for the overall setting. There are lots of great images online but I didn't take any photos in the plaza. Seemed pointless given the web.

Montserrat with the top of the basilica comples just visible over the trees.
![Montserrat setting](../imagesBarca22/MSSetting.jpg)

The wind was whipping across the plaza and we pretty much put on all our jackets and sweaters and hats. The temperature at Montserrat was about 5 C less than Barcelona with a good breeze. Also cooled off a little due to clearing skies. Once we got bundled up we went in search of the basicila and other sights. Started with a visit to candle alley (I think I saw a sign that said Ave Maria). Anyway this is where you can buy a candle (tall format in glass container) to light to placate the pagan gods who are tormenting someone you care about. The alley deadends so we came back and stood in the atrium which didn't have any apparent suggestions for where we were welcome. Eventually we saw someone pull on the modern looking doors in the front and realized that would get us into the main part of the Basilica. No markers just go on in and look. It looks something like this...

Basical of Montserrat
![Basical of Montserrat](../imagesBarca22/MSBasilica.jpg)

We sat and looked around at all the dramatic materials and renderings everywhere. The stained glass is actually pretty nice relative to others we've seen. I was particularly taken with what I think are lamp holders from the days when illumination was via candles and natural light. The lamp holders pictured are just a few of the line of unique iterations that ran from end to end on both sides of the main floor.

Lamp holders (a few)
![Lamp Holders](../imagesBarca22/MSLuminaires.jpg)

The organ had to have been redesigned and installed in the not to distant past. It has a very clear modern sense. I was particularly taken with the shorter pipe projecting like trumpets from the front of the pipe array. Very different than the ones we saw on Thursday when we were at the Museo de la Música (see above). 

Monserrat Pipe Organ.
![Monserrat Pipe Organ](../imagesBarca22/MSOrgan.jpg)

As we sat in the pews at the front admiring the craftsmanship and artistry we noticed that a stream of people were passing along the side behind the chapels and up into the back of the altar area to see the [Black Madonna](https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/m/montserrat-black-madonna.php). As we wandered back along the other side there was a special chapel with glass wall and door and a few pews. The altar in this chapel was a fascinating example of a style we saw in several places where instead features carved in relief they were incised into the stone. In this case just a face, hands, and feet. Interestingly the hair on the head of Jesus was very much 'black' hair which as interesting alignment with the Black Madonna. For the time being I have Dawn's image in which the head is washed out due to the contrast in the lighting. Can't figure out how to search for it on the web.

Minimalist altar in side chapel of Montserrat sanctuary.
![Minimalist altar](../imagesBarca22/MSMinimal.jpg)

Following the lead of those we had seen we headed to the right of the sanctuary doors where there were admitting folks to walkk behind the private chapels to the stairs that lead up behind the main altar to pass in fron of the Black Madonna. Along the way were many remarkable mosaics and marble work. In some places you could see the difference in the patina of the marble which had be touched by human hands repeatedly over the centuries and the marble that was higher that person would usualy reach. I took a picture of the side by side mosaic of the sun and the moon to share with the astronomy students. 

Sun and Moon Mosaics
![Sun and Moon Mosaics](../imagesBarca22/MSMoonSun.jpg)

Climbing up the stairs to the Black Madonna is like walking into the illuminated inside of some mega-star's jewelery box. It just kept getting more gilded and more glittery the closer you got. The Madonna herself is protected by a circular glass screen but because the faithful expect to be able to touch the Madonna (remarkably pagan if you see it that way) the orb in the right hand of the Madonna extends through a hole in the glass and is polished smooth. In spite of many signs along the way asking everyone to NOT touch the Madonna in times of COVID nearly everyone did anyway. The power of gods eh?

If you looked to the corners as you approached the Madonna you could see that there was a small, relatively speaking, santuary and alter behind the main basilica altar. Very sumptuous looking. Is that for the monks to worship in at this still active monastery? It would certainly hold the 80 or so monks at the still active monastery.

Seemed like a good time to have lunch so we had our sandwiches that we had broaght with us on the plaza. We did find a 'No Picnicing' sign later but it wasn't clear whether it applied the whole plaze or just the corner where we found the sign. hile we waited for the boy's choir to sing at 1:00 (M-F they sing at 1:00 and 6:45 but 6:45 is after the last ride home) we walked to the back of the complex to see if we could find a trail map. The Montserrat massif is a natural area of some size and the Monastery is just one access point. We did find a map although it wasn't entirely clear how moch exertion would be needed for each of them. We started up a trail which appeared to lead to towards the top of the mountain. A seemingly endless series of stairs which weren't being great for my knees. In hindsight it reminds me a little of the descriptions of the endless stair where Gandalf pursued the Balrog to the top and his doom. Since we didn't have endless time for the endless stair we went back down to get in line for the boy's choir at 1:00. 

We got to the atrium at 12:40 and found two long lines. One for those 'with reservations' and one for those without. I still can't find anything that suggests that you can even get reservations for the performance. The santuary only holds 450 or so people. When the finally cut the line off (after letting all those with reservations in and then letting in some from the no reservations line) we were standing at the rope. Bummer! **Note to self:** If we go back figure out what this reservation thing is. 

After that disappointment (we could hear the choir sing through the speakers) we headed down just below the basilica in search of a cup of coffee. Avoiding all the sit down restaurants we ended up at the cafeteria (it actually a cafeteria) where we waited through a pretty long line to get a cup of coffee. We needed the caffeine but not the aggravation of waiting through chow line with everyone else just to get a cup of coffee.

After the cup of coffee we headed along the base of the basilica towards the end of the complex where I thought we might find a sculpture I had seen in some descriptions of Montserrat. A short distance down the road past the booths hawking various ag products and next to the parking area for the tour buses we found the scupture. Still looks nice but there was a fence around it (perhaps to keep climbers from climbing on it?) which detracted somewhat from the installation. You can judge for yourself.

Montserrat sculpture
![Montserrat sculpture](../imagesBarca22/MSStackedBlocks.jpg)

As we walked along the base of the basilica I took this quick image of one of the stone blocks of which the complex is built. It is cut from the same rugged conglomerate that forms the cliffs of the massif.

Building Blocks
![Building Blocks](../imagesBarca22/MSBlock.jpg)

Bruce had now rested enough to consider attempting the endless stair again. After some discussion we elected (pressure from Bruce) to try a slight less stair driven hike to the Ermita de San Miguel. This 'trail' works it's way around the massif and up onto the shoulder. It is a wide concreted path for all of the way to the Ermita which will henceforth be the model for Dawn's next studio (including the mountain setting). I need to do some research to see what I can find out about the remarkable looking altar in the Ermita. We couldn't go in but looking through the grill of the door it seemed very unusual and beautiful. It tooks us about 30 min to get to the ermita where we sat and enjoyed the view while Dawn sketched a little. Very lovely. 

Model for Dawn's next studio....
![Next Studio](../imagesBarca22/MSNewStudio.jpg)

...and the studio setting is important too....
![Next Studio Setting](../imagesBarca22/MSStudioSet.jpg)

Finally, I'll include my happy face being out of town and surrounded by trees again. Both Dawn and I are such country mice.
