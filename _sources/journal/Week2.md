### Week 2: 28/3/2022 - 3/4/2022

This will be the first week of classes. Hard to know how that will change these entries though I DON'T propose to document my course materials here in any way. We'll see what transpires. Still lots of things going on put perhaps a little less for the first part of the week when we have classes.
