## History of the COCC Study Abroad Program

According to the college website the Study Abroad program has existed in it's current form for 8 years. At this point I am only aware of Jon Bouknight's group in 2015, Michael Waller's group in 2017, and Mick McCann's group in 2019. Absent the disruptive effect of the COVID pandemic we were originally intending to be in Barcelona in Fall of 2021. After some discussion it was deemed prudent to delay the program until Spring of 2022 to provide sufficient time for participant recruitment and the settling of COVID related uncertainties.

### COCC's International Program:

In the 90's we had an active International Program where we hosted international students (usually from Japan?). This provided a wonderful group of students across the campus that we all benefited from. (need to track this down as well -- I wonder who drove that program?)

#### Questions to Pursue:
Talk to Sara Henson about the history - she will have other suggestions I'm sure.  
What about our Costa Rica program?  
Was there a program in the 90's?  
Who has been involved besides the folks noted above?  
Whose was the impetus for the program (Jim Jones/Bart Queary?)?
