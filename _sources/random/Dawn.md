Hope this doesn't get too carried away.....

### Life Drawing:

[Metafora Studio Arts](https://metafora-studio-arts.org/) This is a studio arts program (largely in English which seems off in some ways) that may have some open life drawing classes. There is also their [artist talks](https://metafora-studio-arts.org/artist-talks/) program which might also be an interesting way to connect.

### Print Studios:

[Print Making Barcelona](https://printmakingbarcelona.com/en/) This studio has presses and courses along with possible residencies. Also known as Ignasi Aguirre Estudi de Gravat for the print maker who created the space. This studio is just off La Rambla (a block or so from Casa Peira that represents Pan Pastels). My best guess is that the studio is upstairs behind the door next to the closed cafe in the street view image.

Plaça Bonsuccés, 5 Entlo

[Atelier Spritz](https://www.atelierspritz.com/) This fabric printing studio seems like a welcoming environment. Appears to be at least some collograph/masking techniques used.

[Print Workers Barcelona](https://www.printworkersbarcelona.com/en/) This is primarily a silk screen studio. Just putting it here to keep track of it.

### Pan Pastels:

[Vincenç Piera](https://vpiera.com/) is the actual [Pan Pastels](https://panpastel.com/home.html) rep in Barcelona. Casa Piera Bellas Artes is an easily confused art store near La Rambla. Now that we have this figured out many things make more sense including why nobody at Casa Piera had any idea what we were talking about. See below for the addresses of the stores.

### Pan Pastels: Demo

For whatever reason the demo's seem to be unrelated to the business listed above even though the last names are the same. Very confusing. Here are the two demo days and addresses.

**May 12** 18:00 at Carrer Cósega 298. Contact Anna Pierra. This is about a block on the other side of Passeig de Gracia near the Expanish classrooms. We'll visit shortly to get it in our heads. The Diagonal metro station on either L3 or L5 is a block away.

**May 19** 18:00 at Via Augusta 161. Contact Jordi Piera. This location is one we walked past on our way back from the Tibidabo hike the first week. It's about 8 blocks away from Bente's hotel in Gracia. The Muntaner metro stop on L6 is about a block away. L6 can be accessed at Catalunya or Diagonal.

### Street Artists:

[Guide to Barcelona Street Artists](https://theculturetrip.com/europe/spain/articles/10-barcelona-street-artists-you-need-to-know/)



There appear to be a number of urban sketching groups in Barcelona. This one seems to have found animals somewhere in Barca is you believe their blog. 

[Urban Sketchers Barcelona](https://urbansketchersbarcelona.blogspot.com/) seems to be a fairly current and active site. [Urban Sketchers Spain](http://spain.urbansketchers.org/) seems to be out of date with no particular events listed on their calendar. 

There is a reference to BCN Dibuixa (Dibujo - es) which is a fall festival honoring drawing in all it's forms. This festival is usually sometime in October.

### Kettlebell Training:

Dawn loves kettlebell training. There is at least one training facility in Barcelona. [Kettlebells Barcelona](https://www.kettlebellsbarcelona.com/) looks like they have regular classes every day and they are [two blocks up from our classroom](https://www.kettlebellsbarcelona.com/contacto) on Carrer Casp. There is also a [kettlebell training Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/nomadfit-entrenamiento-al-aire-libre-bcn/) that trains with kettlebells in the park every few weeks. 

### Blues/Swing/Jazz Dancing:

Dawn and I met dancing and we imagine that if we are at a loss for something to do we might go hunt up the swing dancing groups in Barcelona and see what they are doing. [BCN Swing](https://www.bcnswing.org/escoles-de-ball/) is a website that aggregates all the many dance opportunities of this type.

### Rucs de la Serralda

This is a [donkey farm](https://rucs.cat/) that offers rides for children near Barcelona. We're trying to find ways to get out of town into the villages and farm country to see life outside of the city. [Can Gel](https://www.can-gel.com/es/) is dairy farm that offers tours of it's operation and some samples. 

### Getting out of the city via Train

We were introduced to Daniel at the Kettlebell studio who is originally from Phoenix but has been living and working in Spain for the last 18 years mostly in Madrid (currently working in Barcelona). I asked him about getting out into the countryside and he noted that you can ride the train out and get off a one stop and walk to another stop and get back on. This keeps you from getting totally lost but at the same time allows you to walk between small villages. He has recently been to Vic which is at the end of one of the linesto do some walking.
