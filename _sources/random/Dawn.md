Hope this doesn't get too carried away.....

[Metafora Studio Arts](https://metafora-studio-arts.org/) This is a studio arts program (largely in English which seems off in some ways) that may have some open life drawing classes. There is also their [artist talks](https://metafora-studio-arts.org/artist-talks/) program which might also be an interesting way to connect.

### Print Studios:

[Print Making Barcelona](https://printmakingbarcelona.com/en/) This studio has presses and courses along with possible residencies. Also known as Ignasi Aguirre Estudi de Gravat for the print maker who created the space. This studio is just off La Rambla (a block or so from Casa Peira that represents Pan Pastels). My best guess is that the studio is upstairs behind the door next to the closed cafe in the street view image.

Plaça Bonsuccés, 5 Entlo

[Atelier Spritz](https://www.atelierspritz.com/) This fabric printing studio seems like a welcoming environment. Appears to be at least some collograph/masking techniques used.

[Print Workers Barcelona](https://www.printworkersbarcelona.com/en/) This is primarily a silk screen studio. Just putting it here to keep track of it.

### Pan Pastels:

[Casa Piera Bellas Artes](https://casapiera.com/es/) These folks represent [Pan Pastels](https://panpastel.com/home.html) in Barcelona. It is just a block or so from La Rambla and a couple of blocks from Print Making Barcelona (Ignasi Aguirre Estudi de Gravat).

### Street Artists:

[Guide to Barcelona Street Artists](https://theculturetrip.com/europe/spain/articles/10-barcelona-street-artists-you-need-to-know/)



There appear to be a number of urban sketching groups in Barcelona. This one seems to have found animals somewhere in Barca is you believe their blog. 

[Urban Sketchers Barcelona](https://urbansketchersbarcelona.blogspot.com/) seems to be a fairly current and active site. [Urban Sketchers Spain](http://spain.urbansketchers.org/) seems to be out of date with no particular events listed on their calendar. 

There is a reference to BCN Dibuixa (Dibujo - es) which is a fall festival honoring drawing in all it's forms. This festival is usually sometime in October.

### Kettlebell Training:

Dawn loves kettlebell training. There is at least one training facility in Barcelona. [Kettlebells Barcelona](https://www.kettlebellsbarcelona.com/) looks like they have regular classes every day and they are [two blocks up from our classroom](https://www.kettlebellsbarcelona.com/contacto) on Carrer Casp. There is also a [kettlebell training Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/nomadfit-entrenamiento-al-aire-libre-bcn/) that trains with kettlebells in the park every few weeks. 

### Blues/Swing/Jazz Dancing:

Dawn and I met dancing and we imagine that if we are at a loss for something to do we might go hunt up the swing dancing groups in Barcelona and see what they are doing. [BCN Swing](https://www.bcnswing.org/escoles-de-ball/) is a website that aggregates all the many dance opportunities of this type.
