## Purpose:

As I have been preparing for this study abroad experience there are many ways that I have considered approaching the experience. The advise from experienced long term travellers is clearly to be willing and able to adapt to what happens. Makes enormous sense. At the same time there is no downside to having thought in advance about possible opportunities for exploration that might provide a doorway to connection and shared experiences with locals. For me this includes places to hike, makerspaces, and sustainable living. For Dawn this is often connected to art through life drawing, print studios, or gallery shows. It's all very well to have a vast list of web links on my browser but it feels more accessible to have such possibilities embedded in this book in a way which allows me/us to scan through and see what might be interesting to try today.

This section of the book is aimed at collecting such possible opportunities in a compact location.

### Current Structure:

**Bruce:** Bruce's interests.

**Dawn:** Dawn's interests

**Hikes:** As you would expect

**Classic:** Not sure how much effort I will put into this but perhaps there is value in having the classic tourist spots linked in this way in case we forget or don't have access to the web.
