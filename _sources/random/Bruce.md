Hope this doesn't get too carried away.....

### Makerspaces/Hackerspaces:

Makerspaces are a tool that I use to explore communities. With more and more folks living in urban areas where they may have little access to tools or the opportunity to build/create makerspaces fill a multifaceted need. In searching for makerspaces in Barcelona I found a reference to a network of community makerspaces called Ateneus de Fabricació. Fab Labs in the US are a specific creature based on the MIT community makerspace while in Barcelona the 'Fab Lab' term seems to be used more generically.

### Ateneus de Fabricació

This is a network of makerspaces/fab labs that appears to be supported at least in part by the city.

[What is the Ateneus de Fabricació network?](https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/ateneusdefabricacio/en/what-is-the-ateneus-de-fabricacio-network/)This was a fascinating read. I find myself very curious to visit each lab in the network. Here they are:

[Ateneu de Fabricació de les Corts](https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/ateneusdefabricacio/en/les-corts-fab-lab/) This makerspace is in the Biblioteca Montserrat Abello which is in the Lex Corts barri near Camp Nou (the football stadium). Check the link for hours of operation. 

[Fàbrica del Sol Fab Lab](https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/ateneusdefabricacio/en/fabrica-del-sol-fab-lab/) This makerspace is near the Barceloneta a modest distance from our classrooms. Roughly the same part of the city but toward the beach.

[Ciutat Meridiana Fab Lab](https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/ateneusdefabricacio/en/ciutat-meridiana-fab-lab/) aThis makerspace is  on the north edge of the city on the way to Sabadell and Terrassa. It appears that it may have a bit of a focus on manufacturing. 

[Technology Park Fab Lab](https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/ateneusdefabricacio/en/nou-barris-technology-park-fab-lab/) is a venue located in the Nou Barris Technology Park (the central park for Nou Barris). Also located on the north edge of the city though closer in than the Meridiana Fab Lab. 

[Gràcia Ateneu de Fabricació Digital](https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/ateneusdefabricacio/en/gracia-fab-lab/) This lab is located about a 20 min walk NW from the school on the other side of Avinguda Diagonal in the Gràcia Barri (what a surprise).

#### Other Makerspaces/Hackerspaces

[MADE makerspace barcelona](https://made-bcn.org/) This makerspace was founded by three folks and is located in the Sant Barri also out near Camp Nou (south of the stadium). It appears to me that they use Jupyterbook or Sphinx to manage their static web pages -- Appears to have a different focus and connection to the community. Can't wait to visit.

[ATTA33](https://atta33.com/) This makerspace seems slightly focused on the needs of the architectural community at the nearby Disseny (design) Center. This one is just a few blocks from the school towards the Torre Glóries. 

[TransfoLAB BCN](https://www.transfolabbcn.com/) This very cool makerspace seeks to address a number of issues and projects related to the repurposing or reuse of waste in many forms. It has a makerspace but also residencies and an informal learning academy. Many classes are offered for students of different ages. Looks like a very cool space. Just a few blocks towards the beach from ATTA33 noted above.
