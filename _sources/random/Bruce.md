## Bruce: My Interests

Hope this doesn't get too carried away.....

### Makerspaces/Hackerspaces:

Makerspaces are a tool that I use to explore communities. With more and more folks living in urban areas where they may have little access to tools or the opportunity to build/create makerspaces fill a multifaceted need. In searching for makerspaces in Barcelona I found a reference to a network of community makerspaces called Ateneus de Fabricació. Fab Labs in the US are a specific creature based on the MIT community makerspace while in Barcelona the 'Fab Lab' term seems to be used more generically.

### Ateneus de Fabricació

This is a network of makerspaces/fab labs that appears to be supported at least in part by the city.

[What is the Ateneus de Fabricació network?](https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/ateneusdefabricacio/en/what-is-the-ateneus-de-fabricacio-network/)This was a fascinating read. I find myself very curious to visit each lab in the network. Here they are:

[Ateneu de Fabricació de les Corts](https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/ateneusdefabricacio/en/les-corts-fab-lab/) This makerspace is in the Biblioteca Montserrat Abello which is in the Lex Corts barri near Camp Nou (the football stadium). Check the link for hours of operation. 

[Fàbrica del Sol Fab Lab](https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/ateneusdefabricacio/en/fabrica-del-sol-fab-lab/) This makerspace is near the Barceloneta a modest distance from our classrooms. Roughly the same part of the city but toward the beach.

[Ciutat Meridiana Fab Lab](https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/ateneusdefabricacio/en/ciutat-meridiana-fab-lab/) aThis makerspace is  on the north edge of the city on the way to Sabadell and Terrassa. It appears that it may have a bit of a focus on manufacturing. 

[Technology Park Fab Lab](https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/ateneusdefabricacio/en/nou-barris-technology-park-fab-lab/) is a venue located in the Nou Barris Technology Park (the central park for Nou Barris). Also located on the north edge of the city though closer in than the Meridiana Fab Lab. 

[Gràcia Ateneu de Fabricació Digital](https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/ateneusdefabricacio/en/gracia-fab-lab/) This lab is located about a 20 min walk NW from the school on the other side of Avinguda Diagonal in the Gràcia Barri (what a surprise).

#### Other Makerspaces/Hackerspaces

[MADE makerspace barcelona](https://made-bcn.org/) This makerspace was founded by three folks and is located in the Sant Barri also out near Camp Nou (south of the stadium). It appears to me that they use Jupyterbook or Sphinx to manage their static web pages -- Appears to have a different focus and connection to the community. Can't wait to visit.

[ATTA33](https://atta33.com/) This makerspace seems slightly focused on the needs of the architectural community at the nearby Disseny (design) Center. This one is just a few blocks from the school towards the Torre Glóries. 

[TransfoLAB BCN](https://www.transfolabbcn.com/) This very cool makerspace seeks to address a number of issues and projects related to the repurposing or reuse of waste in many forms. It has a makerspace but also residencies and an informal learning academy. Many classes are offered for students of different ages. Looks like a very cool space. Just a few blocks towards the beach from ATTA33 noted above.

### Alfaro:

This small town is [located](https://www.google.com/maps/place/26540+Alfaro,+La+Rioja,+Spain/@41.990806,-1.7258596,9.53z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0xd5a5c29275a9899:0x4756601f55a167cd!8m2!3d42.1772977!4d-1.7502311) about 60 km west of Zaragoza. It is the current home of Hermano Jesus who was a Spanish Lit teacher for my brothers and I when we lived in Venezuela in 1972. Brian and I are hoping to perhaps visit him during our time in Spain. 

Alfaro is a small town located along the [Camino Ignaciano](https://caminoignacianocouk.wordpress.com/) which is another less traveled camino like the well known Camino Santiago. The linked blog descibes the entire camino which starts near Bilbao and finishes just outside Barcelona in Manresa. Ignacius Loyola is one of the founders of the Jesuit order and this camino traces his trek to get to Jerusalem in 1522 during the plague.

All of which is nice but what is cool is that Alfaro is often visited for the stork population that is resident from December through August each year. A Spanish version of the storks in Denmark and other European locations.

### Commomland and Planeses Farm (near Girona)

Ana Vara who works with the Pine Meadow Ranch project in Sisters mentioned a group she had studied for her PhD called [Commomland](https://www.commonland.com/about/). This fascinating project operates in many locations around the world. In Spain their current projects are mostly in the Almeria region (Calle Paseo 1, 04825 Chirivel, Almería) of Andalusia which is far from Barcelona. In the process of exploring their site I happened across other efforts labeled as 'regenerative agriculture'. In particular there was a reference to Marc Gracia who is running [Planeses Farm](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Planeses+Agricultura+Regenerativa/@42.1947805,2.6731271,13z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x12bab88107672d09:0x1edb153cec4a6dbe!8m2!3d42.2078742!4d2.6620459) north of Girona. This [polycultural experimental farm](https://polyfarming.eu/) seemed like a potential location to visit. They also have produced a wonderful Polyfarming Manual which I will need to explore more closely. The farm has some relationship with CREAF at the Universitat Autonomous de Barcelona. The closest town to the farm is Besalu which is referenced as a well preserved medieval town. In the [description of the town](https://travelinspires.org/besalu-spain-travel-guide/) there is a reference to the Caminos de Sefarad which piqued my interest. Turns out there is a project to reveal the passage of the Jewish Community through Spain and places of interest to explore. There is a [tourist guide](https://redjuderias.org/guias-turisticas/) for many of the larger cities and the Barcelona guide may provide some interesting places to explore.

### Larroque-Saint-Sernin

This is the locale for Anita Lehmann's painting workshop which starts after the Easter holiday (4/18 - 4/26). Getting there would be an adventure for sure. Barcelona to Narbonne and Narbonne to Toulouse can be accomplished pretty smoothly on Renfe and TGV (high speed trains). From Toulous there is a local train which gets you to Auch. At that point it bus or taxi to Larroque-Saint-Sernan which is hopefully close to the atelier which sounds lovely in this [article from Interior Design](https://interiordesign.net/projects/nbbj-s-rysia-suchecka-talks-about-how-she-reinvented-a-french-farmhouse/)

### Stan Meyerhoff

If I get some time it might be fun to go find Stan and say hi. His email and address is in my password manager. Out of appreciation for his desire for anonymity I'm not posting specific information here. He and his partner live close to the border with Spain in France. Figueres is the nearest train stop in Spain. A bit fussy to get from there. Car might be the easiest if we wanted to rent.

### Our Apartment:

Today (3/16/2022) we heard that our apartment is at Carrer del Clot 182 3rd floor, 2

### Acrobatics School

This is just a temporary tag for future reference since it is just up the street from our apartment.
