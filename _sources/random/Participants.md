## Participants: Known Interests

Without naming any names here are some resources for known interests of some of our participants.

### Rugby

[Professional Rugby: FC Barca](https://www.fcbrugby.com/) This is the website for the local professional team (both men and women). At the moment there are no matches scheduled since they are between seasons. Perhaps there will be some games while we are there.

[Rugby Clubs in Barcelona](https://www.shbarcelona.com/blog/en/rugby-barcelona/)There are a number of clubs and pickup games in Barcelona. This webpage links a number of them including a touch rugby meetup on Wednesday nights. If you've never seen a rugby game consider going to one with Roy who plays for COCC's team.

[Rugby Club Listing](https://www.forbarcelonalovers.com/es/mejores/clubs-de-rugby-en-barcelona) This feels like a pretty complete listing of the many rugby clubs in the Barcelona area.

### Football

It is hard to imagine going to Barcelona and not taking in a football match of some kind. Even with Lionel Messi gone football is culturally central to residents of Barcelona.

[FC Barca Mens:](https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/) This is the homepage (English) for the club. From here you can find schedules and tickets. It's worth noting that there are a couple of home games a month while we are in Barcelona. Tickets start at €79 and go up from there. The 'cheap' seats are behind the goals and in the corners. Seats along the sides of the pitch tend to start around €120. Sort of like a day at Mt Bachelor! For the mens home games we might have to buy tickets soon before they sell out. 

[FC Barca Femini (Women's)](https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/football/womens-football/news) FC Barca has a great women's team as well. They are currently the European Champions. They usually play in a slightly different (smaller) stadium. There are a number of home games for the women's team while we are in Barcelona. Ticket prices for the women's games start at €9 behind the goals and €20-30 along the sidelines. Doubtless a different cultural experience than the mens game but a lot less costly. I'm certainly hoping to go to one of these games while we're there. There is a womens Champions Cup game at the end of March in Camp Nou but only a few VIP tickets are still available.

### Water Polo

It seems like there is quite a bit going on in the water polo scene in Barcelona. If you are interested here are some starting points. I suspect there some ways to be involved in open games but the websites mostly feature their competition teams. Stop in and ask to find out how you could get involved.

[Barcelona International Water Polo Academy (BIWPA)](https://www.biwpa.com/)This water polo academy is located over near Camp Nou (the football stadium) and may have some opportunities for open play. You would have to contact them to see.

[Club Natacio Barcelona](http://www.cnb.cat/activitats-adults-multiesport/#Activitats%20Multiesport) This swim facility is just south of the Barceloneta Beach and offers a range of activites from yoga to SUP (stand up paddleboard) yoga to pilates. Water polo is just one of many things happening at this facility.

[Club Espotiu Mediterrani](https://clubesportiumediterrani.com/seccions-esportives/waterpolo-femeni/) This is another multisport facility that hosts a number of water polo teams

### Art Museums

This section will be ridiculously long and perhaps I will move it to it's own page:)
