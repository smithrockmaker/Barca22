### Online Student Guide:

One of the most useful resources from our hosts is the [online student guide](https://sites.google.com/barcelonasae.com/onlinestudentguide/home). This is a extensive document so approach it in small steps. Start with the Onsite Staff Directory to learn about the people you will meet in Barcelona and then go through the Pre-Departure Orientation. After that explore the different parts as you have questions about living and studying in Barcelona.

### Student Stories:

#### Experiences:

Barcelona SAE does a great job of providing insight into the study abroad experience through the voices of real students on their experiences [webpage](https://www.barcelonasae.com/experiences/). I hope you find these stories as uplifting and motivating as I do.

#### The Blog:

For a greater range of experiences [the blog](https://blog.barcelonasae.com/) provides more insights into the different perspectives of students who have participated in study abroad, specific degree programs, and interships through Barcelona SAE. I hope that you will feel like sharing some insights from your stay in Barcelona on the blog.
