## Schedule (7/1/2022):

### Big Picture

Leave Portland March 21
Return to Portland (leave Barca) June 1

### Weekly Course Schedule

This is the current schedule of classes for each week while we are in Barcelona. Be aware that we are likely to meet outside of these times in locations around the city. These are merely the times that we have a classroom available at 130 Carrer Casp. The Spanish language class looks long because there may be different sections for different students depending on the level of their language skills.

**Comments:**

Given the time differences (Barcelona is 9 hrs ahead of Bend) I wonder if we won't be leaving Portland on March 20th to arrive in Barcelona on March 21.

March 22 you will be finding your way from your homestays to the school at 130 Carrer Casp as mentioned in the newsletter.

This week is all about getting settled and finding your way around. We will meet for COCC class Wednesday morning at the school to practice the pattern but mostly we will establish our class patterns.
