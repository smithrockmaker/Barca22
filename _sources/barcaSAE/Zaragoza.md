## Zaragoza Weekend: April 8,9,10

### Overall Plan

* Guided tour of the city center (including the cathedrals: Basílica del Pilar and La Seo)
* Visit to the Museo del Foro de Caesaraugusta
* Palacio de la Aljafería
* Museo del Teatro Caesaraugusta
* Guided Tour of Old Town of Belchite (Civil War)

#### Thoughts from Bruce:
* A2 - the route to Segeda passes through La Muela which is a massive wind farm on both sides of the route. Stopping anywhere along this route in the wind farm would allow a 30 min discussion of the structure of wind farms and wind turbines. Possible cultural discussion of politics given that the Mayor of La Muela was a great booster for wind farms in Aragon but was also convicted of substantial corruption recently.

* Segeda itself is a great example of using astronomical cycles connected to physical objects as markers for important dates. Beside the historic sense of people in Iberia long before modern European culture seems valuable. www.segeda.net/8cia/pdf/11_3_Arqueoastronomia_Burillo.pdf

* Retracing the road back to A-220 could take us smoothly to Belchite depending on schedule.
* From Belchite about 10 km E on A-1307 is an unusual solar farm that is a tracking system (most are fixed) which would support a valuable discussion about why this approach is no longer cost effective and how it is (slightly) more efficient at providing power.
