#### Aragon/Zaragoza

The weekend of April 8th is when we plan to visit Zaragoza and the region around it. During that trip we are planning to visit Belchite (a Civil War site) and it turns out there is an unusual solar farm just 10 km E of Belchite. This solar farm uses a full tracking system to maximize the energy generated from the sun. This is unusual because as the cost of panels has dropped it is no longer cost effective to build tracking systems for the modest amount of energy gain.

#### Classroom Building

There is, or was, a flat panel solar array (PV) on the roof of the classroom building at Carrer Casp. Would be good and interesting to see if there is a monitoring panel in the building or accessible via software. It's possible that this is a solar hot water array but not sure from the satellite view.

#### Hotel Ayer Casp

This hotel (across the street and up about 1/2 a block from the classroom building) seems to have a solar hot water system on it's roof. This would also make a great visit if it's accessible. Hot water is a serious expense in Barca though only some buildings seem to have rooftop systems installed.
