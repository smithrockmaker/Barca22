#### Aragon/Zaragoza

The weekend of April 8th is when we plan to visit Zaragoza and the region around it. During that trip we are planning to visit Belchite (a Civil War site) and it turns out there is an unusual solar farm just 10 km E of Belchite. This solar farm uses a full tracking system to maximize the energy generated from the sun. This is unusual because as the cost of panels has dropped it is no longer cost effective to build tracking systems for the modest amount of energy gain.
