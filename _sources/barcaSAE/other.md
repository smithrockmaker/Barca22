## Other Sustainability Resources:

Water is often a hidden resource need in energy production. Solar thermal projects require large volumes of water to turn to steam to generate electricity. This is also true of nuclear power. Steam powered electricity generation competes with agriculture and direct human use for this relatively scarce resource.

### Irrigation:

During the period of al Andalus (Islamic empire in the Iberian peninsula) water for agriculture was also an issue. One of the great technological development of the Islamic scientists was the the create of highly effective irrigation delivery systems. Here are some resources discussing how this technology continues to this day.
