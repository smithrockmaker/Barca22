## Checklists for Barcelona 2022

I will try not to duplicate other checklists too much in this effort. As part of the COCC Study Abroad program it feels like there are three broad sets of tasks to get done before heading off to Barcelona. In my mind these break down into Academic tasks, Financial tasks, and Personal Preparation. 

### Academic:

This checklist contains CRNs for the courses you need to register for and other academic planning suggestions.

### Financial:

This checklist suggests tasks associated with financial matters related to your time in Barcelona.

### Personal:

This checklist has resources to guide your packing for Barcelona.
