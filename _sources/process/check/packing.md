## Checklist: Packing

The packing suggestions from Barcelona SAE's Online Student Guide are linked on the Checklist: Personal page. I found them helpful but incomplete so I have decided to keep track of my personal packing list here for future reference. Let me know what you find that you added or subtracted from the lists.

### Luggage Sizes:

The question of how big and/or heavy can my luggage be is a perennial one. Here are the official guidelines.

#### Person Item: Hard to Say

This is the one that is most unclear.This definition seems very reasonable and acknowledges that the space under the seat in front of you can vary wildly. 

> "A personal item is your secondary bag which you bring onboard the airplane and store under the seat in front of you. Your personal item may be a purse, laptop bag, backpack, tote, or any other small bag. Think bag, not luggage. Airlinesâ€™ are more strict with the size and weight of your personal item if they even publish rules. Most importantly, your personal item must fit under the seat in front of you." - Jamie Ditaranto

This is probably the most abused of the classes of luggage. Remember that this bag will shorten your legroom and could make a long flight much more uncomfortable - something that matters a lot to me at tall as I am. This [luggage size list](https://upgradedpoints.com/travel/airlines/carry-on-luggage-size-chart/) includes some personal item restrictions.

#### Carry On: 22"x14"x9", 22 lbs

22"x14"x9" is a domestic carry on size regardless of what you see at the airport.Remarkably there is no world wide standard. Here is a [list from World Traveler](https://www.worldtraveler.com/pages/international-carry-on-size) that will provide some sense of things. 21"x13"x9" will be somewhat more universally accepted. Weight limits are also pretty variable with 22 lbs being pretty normal but 15 lbs being common in some parts of the world. 

#### Carry On Backpacks: 36-40 liters

A backpack makes a lot of sense for travel depending on the circumstances. It appears that generally a 36L to 40L (liter) backpack will meet carry on requirements. Be careful that you don't strap so much stuff on the outside that it gets bigger than the formal carry on size requirements in the previous section.

#### Checked Bag: 62", 23 kg/50 lbs

Add up the length + width + depth to get total linear dimensions. Be sure to measure from the bottom of the wheels to the top of the handle (when closed). This actually defines a maximum volume. Typically the weight limit is consistent at 23 kg or 50 lbs. You will be charged extra if you go over this limit.

### What I'm wearing:

If you are really tight for space be aware that what you wear isn't considered a personal bag or carry on. This can get nuts. When my family went to S America in the 70's for a year we wore two coats each over a heavy sweater (in August!) with all the pockets full of vitamins and medications. We must have been carrying 15 lbs of stuff in our coats. I'm not feeling that stressed on this trip but I am thinking about comfort on a long trip. Airplanes and airports are sometimes cooler than we expect.

* comfortable pants
* compression socks (for 'older' travelers)
* comfortable walking shoes
* long sleeve shirt
* hanky
* belt
* rain/wind jacket
* travel hat

Nothing in my pockets to deal with. 

### Personal Bag: 

My planned personal bag is quite small so here is my list. Items marked -[x] are in daily use and need to be added to bag at last minute!

* Phone charging cord -[x]
* Headphone charging cord
* eye cover
* glasses/contact container - [x]
* cash (not all)
* 1 KN95 or better mask
* dark glasses - [x]

### Carry On Bag:

I admire those who can travel indefinitely with a single carry on bag. I would have a bigger personal bag if I were going to try this. My global concept is that I'd like to be able to comfortably make it a week with what I have in my carry on bag and personal bag in case my checked bag gets lost. I'm also focused on making sure that critical items like medications and toiletries are in my carry on as well.
