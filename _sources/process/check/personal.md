## Checklist: Personal

As always the Online Student Guide has a great [section on packing](https://sites.google.com/barcelonasae.com/onlinestudentguide/pre-departure-orientation/part-5-packing). This includes suggestions for clothing choices based on both the weather and local culture. These suggestions are all pretty transparent and the following thoughts apply to experiences I have had implementing the suggestions in the guide.

- [ ] Passport and color copy of passport
- [ ] Sufficient medications for the entire trip.

### Passport: 

Check one more time and be sure that your passport is valid for at least 6 months AFTER your return from Barcelona. Make a color copy of your passport and keep it somewhere separate from your actual passport. For our program you will not need a visa since we are in the Schengen zone for less than 90 days. You will be stamped as entering the Schengen zone where ever you first land in the Schengen. This may not be in Spain. Where ever you pass through customs you will be asked about your destination and time you will be there. You **may** be asked to show 'proof of return' (see warning below) so they have evidence that you have the means to leave when your trip is over. Your 90 days starts when you pass through customs.

'Proof of Return'
```
Participants in the COCC Study Abroad Program will normally have a round trip flight booked as part of their program fees. This meets the Schengen 'proof of return' requirement for you to have the means and opportunity to return to some country outside the Schengen zone within 90 days. For participants who choose to purchase their own flights to Barcelona you **may** be asked to show proof that you have a return ticket to a country which will accept you or the funds to purchase such a ticket. If you have a fully refundable ticket within the 90 days you are allowed to stay that will also meet expectations. If you do NOT have a return ticket there you may experience some added challenges entering the Schengen. Be aware!

### Medications:

Medications can pose special challenges in packing for Barcelona. Pharmacies in the US will not generally issue prescriptions for longer than 3 months which probably won't coincide with your trip dates. Pharmacies in Spain may not accept your presciptions since US doctors are not licensed in Spain. Shipping medications to Spain is likely to lead to your medications being stuck in customs. The most effective solution is to bring what you need. Plan ahead and get into your doctor's office to discuss arrangements to get enough of your prescriptions to last though your entire trip. Pack these in your carry on luggage since it is least likely to get lost. 

In the case of lost medications a document from your doctor documenting your prescriptions may be helpful in attempting to solve this challenge. This is NOT a prescription but rather documentation of your prescriptions.
