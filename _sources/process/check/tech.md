## Checklist: Tech

It's not really the tech I'm trying to manage but the cords and dongles that go with the tech. As I am prone to do I'm making a checklist for myself of the bits and pieces of tech that I intended to bring with. Most of this can be purchased in Barcelona if I forget. As usual the items marked -[x] are in daily use and go in at the last minute.
