## Checklist: Academic

This chapter may be among the simpler ones but this will document the various steps needed to assure that the courses that participants take in Barcelona fit into their academic plan. Also included will be registration information and other processes that the college executes to make everything happen.

### Course Registration:

All participants are expected to sign up for HUM 107 (Spanish Culture), Spanish Language (at your level), and at least two of the following - GS 104: Physics (Renewable Energy), GS 107: Astronomy (Astronomy and Science in al Andulus), and MUS 101: Understanding Music (Musical Styles in Barcelona). Because these classes are not open to all COCC students they will not show in the general class schedule. Below are the CRN's for these courses for Spring 2022 in Barcelona.
