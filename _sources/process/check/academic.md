## Checklist: Academic

This chapter may be among the simpler ones but this will document the various steps needed to assure that the courses that participants take in Barcelona fit into their academic plan. Also included will be registration information and other processes that the college executes to make everything happen.

- [ ] Sign up for HUM 107
- [ ] Choose and sign up for Spanish Course

Sign up for at least two out of three:
- [ ] GS 104 Physics (Renewable Energy)
- [ ] GS 107 Astronomy (Islamic Roots of Science)

### Course Registration:

All participants are expected to sign up for HUM 107 (Spanish Culture), Spanish Language (at your level), and at least two of the following - GS 104: Physics (Renewable Energy), GS 107: Astronomy (Astronomy and Science in al Andulus), and MUS 101: Understanding Music (Musical Styles in Barcelona). Because these classes are not open to all COCC students they will not show in the general class schedule. To register go to your Bobcat account and enter the relevant CRNs for the courses you are signing up for. You may find that Bobcat will not let you register. This may be because you haven't shared your ID with the program so we can give you instructor approval to register. Below are the CRN's for these courses for Spring 2022 in Barcelona.

GS 104 Physics and GS 107 Astronomy meet AAOT requirements for Science/Math/Computer Science lab courses while MUS 101 meets AAOT requirements for Arts and Letters. SPAN 201 and above meets AAOT requirements for Cultural Literacy. Please check your degree and program plan so you know how these courses fit with your academic needs.
