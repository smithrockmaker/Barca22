## Metro and Bus Maps:

Like most big cities there are two parts to the public transport system. The above ground part (the buses) and the below ground part (the metro). The images are just samples to illustrate how the map is laid out. The links take you to the full pdf from the [Barcelona Metropolitan Transport (Tranports Metropolitans de Barcelona)](https://www.tmb.cat/en/barcelona-transport). From the linked site you have access to trip planners, passes, and apps for your phone.
