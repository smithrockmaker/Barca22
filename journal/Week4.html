<p>This week is Holy Week (Semana Santa) in the Catholic world. We’re not quite sure how it’s going to play in terms of more busy or less busy nevermind metro schedules. Iria thinks it might be quieter in most parts of the city as many people leave town to spend time with family elsewhere. We shall see….</p>
<div class="section" id="monday">
<h2>11/4/2022 Monday<a class="headerlink" href="#monday" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Today was mostly a recovery day from the Zaragoza trip and dealing with the consequences of Dawn’s phone being stolen. We think everything is under control but we’re watching carefully to make sure the accounts stay quiet.</p>
<p><strong>(I am going to copy this section to my interests document as well)</strong> I got seriously sidetracked this morning with an effort to track down ways to access farms or farm experiences close to Barcelona. Somehow I tripped over this article about <a class="reference external" href="https://www.barcelona-metropolitan.com/living/parc-agrari-farming-in-barcelona-backyard/">Parc Agrari</a> which sounded exactly like what we are looking for. This project seems typical of a number of broad community focused social projects here in Barcelona. The formal name is <a class="reference external" href="https://parcagrari.cat/en">Parc Agrari de Baix Llobregat</a> (the Lower Llobregat Agricultural Park). As I tried to sort out how to access these spaces I was reading <a class="reference external" href="https://parcagrari.cat/sites/default/files/2022-03/DesplegableParcAgrari2018_en_0.pdf">this pdf</a> describing the project I was particularly drawn to the Parc Agrari trail (4) and the Llobregat Trail as well as the directions for getting to the Parc. Interestingly the whole thing raises all sorts of questions for me about how far my metro card will take me and whether I have to get separate tickets every time I step on the Renfre trains. I feel like we came into town on a Renfre train without problems on the day of the Tibidabo walk and we went through the turnstile for R5 to go to Manresa (Montserrat). Would the exit turnstile have complained when we tried to exit? To see the conclusion of this rabbit hole go to the Hikes page under Random Interests.</p>
<p>In the morning we did a little updating on this journal and Dawn got her iPad up and running. She found that her iPhone had synchronized with the cloud and so she hadn’t lost any of the images from the phone. Large relief. We did some laundry and made a big lunch before heading off to Spanish class. Took the Linea Morada since we usually walk from the school. New metro stop to figure out. It’s not quite as close as we could get if we changed lines at Sagrada Familia. The Linea Morada drops us right at Casa Batllo where C/ Aragó and Passieg de Gracia cross. Short walk up to La Pedrada and Expanish. Somehow I had missed the memo that Elena was going to be gone so we got a substitute (Maria) who had a slightly different style but also good. We reviewed and worked with Preterito Indefinido and Preterito Perfecto. Felt like I was the one way behind in class today. We all felt like our brains were struggling more than usual to sort things out.</p>
<p>After class I had a quick chat with Sandra and Maelynn about a housing question. Then we slowly headed out to walk to Kettlebell class for Dawn at 6:00. I had decided that it seemed a little warmed today so I hadn’t brought my sweater because I so often end up carrying it. Today in short sleeves and a bit of a wind I was on the edge of being cold outside for most of the day. Same contrast with locals who are bundled up in hat’s and down coats while I’m wandering around in shirt sleeves. Watched a little kid soccer, found a smaller notebook for Dawn to use at Spanish class, and got some bread for the next couple of days. When class was over we walked home by the usual route through Plaça de Glóries.</p>
<p>We talked a bit on the walk about the pace of Dawn’s Spanish class relative to the skill level of the students. It feels like they may be pushed faster than several of them can keep up with. We have similar but less severe experiences in the ‘advanced’ class.</p>
<p>Salad for dinner. Talked to Denali at home about how things are going. Can’t quite believe that we’re having yet another weird spring with huge temperature swings. Who knows if we’ll have fruit this summer or not.</p>

<div class="section" id="tuesday">
<h2>12/4/2022 Tuesday<a class="headerlink" href="#tuesday" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When we considered what to do with today Dawn suggested that we make it a catch up and recovery day. We’re both (along with others) feeling like we’re behind in Spanish and there are other tasks we feel like we need time to do. It’s a cool and slightly cloudy day so why not? We’re talking back and forth about items from our Spanish classes and I’m pounding away on my journal. All in all seems like good and comforting way to spend the day.</p>
<p>Around 2:00 we were feeling a bit hungry so Dawn asked if we could go try out the Lanto restaurant (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lanto+Restaurant/&#64;41.4116936,2.1889022,18.86z/data=%214m5%213m4%211s0x12a4a38274f48f87:0x2722890298fae96b%218m2%213d41.4116861%214d2.1887683">Carrer de Valéncia 646</a> in el Clot) which I had been wanting to take her to for her birthday. We knew it would be a little more expensive than what we had been doing but the reviews made it seem like it might well be worth it. According to google maps they were open so over we went. What a lovely experience! Yeah, its not a place to eat if you want to go home full. It is a food experience with people who love what they do and are gracious and friendly. If you sit in the front room (pictured below from the designers website) you also have the pleasure of watching each dish be prepared.</p>

<p>Because we didn’t have reservations (+34 658 94 11 31) we were offered a table in the front room which turned out to be extra fun because the opportunity to watch the food being prepared. The menú de día (16.5€) is 3 plates plus dessert (postre)and drink (bebida). Your only choice is the main course (the 3rd plate). Pretty clear that Dawn probably wouldn’t have picked the sardine appetizer if we were eating a la carte but it was delicious and not a bit fishy. The roasted veggies were also lovely. I don’t know if we got two different 1st plates because that was an option or because they kindly set up two different servings for us to try. 2nd plate was a small serving of lovely pasta. The main plate Dawn had cod over spinach with dill and I had pork belly with mushrooms over mashed potatoes. All of it was absolutely marvelous. They do all this work including baking their own bread in a tiny space that you see to the left of the image. Really remarkable. Dessert was more goodness as apple (poached maybe?) over a carmel cream with some crispy ‘cracker’ over the top. Coffee to finish and we felt like we will have to come back once a week just for the taste experience.</p>
<p>Ricardo, Arica, and Simone (from the reviews) are all lovely and may be co-owners. Not sure what the arrangement is. If I have assigned the names in mind correctly Arica and Simone are married. Ricardo is from Perugia Italy not far from Orvieto where we visited Civita de Banoregio with Anita years ago. That would make his native language Italian while he works in a restaurant in Catalonia where he needs Spanish and Catalan and he was happy to try English with us. Crikey. Simone (the wife?) is working on both her Spanish and her English. Perhaps her native tongue is Chinese. A wonderful friendly polyglot crew. What a great way to celebrate a delayed birthday for Dawn!</p>
<p>We will finish the day studying more Spanish and hope to pass our tests tomorrow with more comfort than last week.</p>
