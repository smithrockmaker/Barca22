## Faculty from Past Programs

In chronological order:

### Jon Bouknight: Barcelona 2015

Jon has been a long time pillar of our Communication Department. This is the blurb from the [COCC Faculty profile page](https://www.cocc.edu/home/faculty-profiles/jon-bouknight.aspx) for Jon.

Following the examples of some of the greatest educators in Western history such as Socrates, Aristotle and Cicero, discussion is the cornerstone of all my classes and is what makes them interesting, I hope. I love watching students who get excited about a topic, or who admit to having their long-held beliefs challenged. Also enjoyable are students who reach a personal goal even in a course they'd love to skip. Best of all, though, and selfishly, I most enjoy it when the students teach me something. 

### Michel Waller: Barcelona 2017

Michel is a fabulous faculty member in the Anthropology group. This is the blurb from the [COCC Faculty profile page](https://www.cocc.edu/home/faculty-profiles/michel-waller.aspx) for Michel.

Michel Waller has come full circle. He attended COCC and now teaches anthropology here. His favorite course to teach is Biological Anthropology as it traces 65 million years of primate and human evolution.

"I have always been interested in studying the human condition and anthropology allows me to engage in this pursuit through the bio-cultural influences on our evolution," he says. "Furthermore, anthropology has allowed me to focus on the conservation of apes and monkeys by looking at the many ways humans perceive our closest relatives." He says his teaching style varies, but he strives to encourage students to openly discuss the various course topics in a relaxed and respectful environment.

"I enjoy working with a diverse student body, and I appreciate how invested my students are," he says. "Connecting with students and watching them accomplish their goals is extremely rewarding." 

### Mick McCann: Barcelona 2019

Mick is a stand out faculty in the Geography group at COCC
