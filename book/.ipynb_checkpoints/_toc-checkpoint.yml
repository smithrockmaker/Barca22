# In searching for a model for the structure of this book I have relied heavily
# on the work of Kyle Niemeyer via his Computational Thermo book. The repo lives at
# https://github.com/kyleniemeyer/computational-thermo/tree/master/book. Thanks Kyle
#
# An important consideration for me at the moment is that I can only upgrade jupyter-book
# to v 0.10.1. A number of keys in the _toc.yml file will change for the better when
# I can move to v0.11. This structure is the legacy structure and it is sometimes 
# irksome to find documentation for the legacy versions (seems not very legacy in some
# ways) -- Bruce, July 2021
