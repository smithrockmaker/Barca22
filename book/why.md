## Why This Book?

This book is being created as a project to provide both a learning experience for me and to document as many aspects of the COCC Study Abroad program in Barcelona in the spring of 2022. jupyter{book} is a new tool for me that seems potentially valuable in many aspects of my life. The process of preparing for this program feels rich and complex to me and I'd like to have one document where I can try to keep track of all the moving parts. A book seems like a plausible plan.

### Who is the Audience?

Writing instructors are always asking us to be clear about the audience for any document. To that end I have a variety of audiences in mind as I write this. Perhaps selfishly the first audience is me since this book is meant to serve as a resource for me. Less selfishly I hope that future faculty who participate in the COCC Study Abroad program might find it useful. Last, but certainly not least, I hope that all the participants of the 2022 program in Barcelona will both contribute to and benefit from this record of the experience.

### Structure:

The broad structure of this book will hopefully be apparent in the layout of the contents in the left panel of this webpage or pdf document. I expect that my initial structure will evolve significantly over the course of creating this book.
